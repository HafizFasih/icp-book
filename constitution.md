## **The Constitution of 1973**

**Introduction**
The Constitution of 1973 is the supreme law of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and represents a landmark in the country’s political history. It was passed by the National Assembly on **April 10, 1973**, and came into full force on **August 14, 1973**, during the government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Unlike the previous constitutions of 1956 and 1962, the 1973 Constitution was drafted by the elected representatives of the people and enjoys the distinction of being a consensus document agreed upon by all major political parties of the time. It provides a comprehensive framework for the governance of the state, balancing modern democratic principles with Islamic ideology.

**Salient Features of the 1973 Constitution**
The Constitution consists of 280 articles, 7 schedules, and a preamble. Its key characteristics are as follows:

* **Written and Comprehensive Constitution:**
    It is a fully written document that outlines the structure of the state, the powers of various organs of government, and the rights of citizens. It is comprehensive in nature, detailing every aspect of statecraft to minimize ambiguity.

* **Federal System:**
    The constitution establishes a federal structure comprising four provinces (Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan), the federal capital, and federally administered areas. It originally divided powers between the center and provinces through two lists (Federal and Concurrent), though the **18th Amendment** abolished the Concurrent List, granting greater provincial autonomy.

* **Parliamentary Form of Government:**
    Unlike the 1962 presidential constitution, the 1973 Constitution reintroduced a parliamentary system. The **Prime Minister** is the head of government and holds real executive power, while the **President** is the ceremonial head of state. The Prime Minister is elected by the National Assembly and is answerable to it.

* **Bicameral Legislature:**
    For the first time in Pakistan's history, a bicameral legislature (two houses) was introduced to balance the representation of population and provinces:
    * **National Assembly (Lower House):** Members are elected on the basis of population.
    * **Senate (Upper House):** Provides equal representation to all provinces, ensuring that smaller provinces are not dominated by larger ones.

* **Islamic Provisions:**
    The constitution earned the title of an "Islamic Constitution" due to its specific provisions:
    * **State Religion:** Islam is declared the State Religion of Pakistan.
    * **Sovereignty:** It begins with the affirmation that sovereignty over the universe belongs to Almighty Allah alone.
    * **Muslim Definition:** It clearly defines a Muslim and requires the President and Prime Minister to be Muslims.
    * **Council of Islamic Ideology:** Established to bring laws in conformity with the Quran and Sunnah.

* **Rigid Constitution:**
    It is a rigid constitution, meaning it is not easily amendable. A **two-thirds majority** in both houses of parliament is required to pass any constitutional amendment, ensuring stability and preventing arbitrary changes.

* **Independence of Judiciary:**
    The constitution guarantees an independent judiciary. It establishes the **Supreme Court** as the apex court and **High Courts** in each province. It provides security of tenure for judges and separates the judiciary from the executive to ensure justice and the rule of law.

* **Fundamental Rights:**
    It guarantees fundamental human rights to all citizens, including freedom of speech, assembly, association, and religion, as well as the right to a fair trial, equality before the law, and the inviolability of dignity.

* **Direct Elections and Single Citizenship:**
    Members of the National and Provincial Assemblies are elected directly by the people through adult franchise (voting age 18). Furthermore, the constitution establishes the principle of single citizenship, meaning citizens are Pakistanis first, rather than being identified solely by their provincial residency.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, the Constitution of 1973 is a comprehensive and resilient document that has survived various political upheavals. Its greatest strength lies in its federal and parliamentary character, which accommodates the diverse political and ethnic fabric of Pakistan. By blending democratic values with Islamic principles and ensuring provincial representation through a bicameral legislature, it remains the binding force of the federation and the guarantor of the rights of the people of Pakistan.


## **The Constitution of 1956**

#### **1. Introduction**
After independence in 1947, Pakistan was governed under the Government of India Act 1935 (as interim constitution) for nine years. The long struggle to frame a constitution finally succeeded under the Prime Ministership of **Chaudhry Muhammad Ali**. The first constitution was passed by the Constituent Assembly on 29th February 1956 and was enforced on **23rd March 1956**, declaring Pakistan a Republic. It remained in force for about two and a half years before being abrogated by the first Martial Law in October 1958.

#### **2. Main Features of the 1956 Constitution**
The Constitution of 1956 contained 234 Articles, 13 Parts, and 6 Schedules. Its salient features were as follows:

* **Written and Detailed Document:** It was a lengthy written document that covered not only the fundamental laws but also administrative details. It was partly rigid and partly flexible, meaning amendments could be made with a two-thirds majority in the assembly.
* **Islamic Republic:** For the first time, the country was officially named the **"Islamic Republic of Pakistan."** The Objectives Resolution was included as the Preamble, declaring that sovereignty belongs to Allah Almighty.
* **Federal System:** The constitution established a federal system with two distinct provinces (units): **West Pakistan** and **East Pakistan**. Powers were divided between the Centre and the Provinces through Federal, Provincial, and Concurrent lists.
* **Parliamentary Form of Government:** The system adopted was parliamentary.
    * The **Prime Minister** was the Head of Government and held real executive powers. He and his cabinet were collectively responsible to the National Assembly.
    * The **President** was the Head of State, a largely ceremonial role, but he had the power to appoint the PM and dissolve the assembly under specific conditions.
* **Unicameral Legislature:** Unlike the current bicameral system, the 1956 Constitution introduced a **unicameral legislature** (one house) known as the National Assembly.
* **Principle of Parity:** To resolve the representation conflict between East and West Pakistan, the constitution adopted the "Principle of Parity." The National Assembly consisted of **300 members**, divided equally with **150 members from East Pakistan** and **150 from West Pakistan**.
* **Independence of Judiciary:** The constitution guaranteed an independent judiciary. The Supreme Court was the apex court, with the power to interpret the constitution and enforce fundamental rights.
* **National Languages:** Both **Urdu** and **Bengali** were declared the national languages of Pakistan to satisfy the demands of the Bengali population.
* **Fundamental Rights:** Citizens were granted fundamental rights, including freedom of speech, assembly, movement, and religion. These rights were enforceable by the courts.

#### **3. Islamic Provisions**
The 1956 Constitution included several specific Islamic provisions:
* **Head of State:** It was mandatory that the President of Pakistan must be a Muslim.
* **Repugnancy to Islam:** No law could be passed that was repugnant (contrary) to the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah.
* **Islamic Ties:** The state was constitutionally bound to strengthen bonds with other Muslim countries.
* **Elimination of Riba:** The state promised to work toward eliminating Riba (interest) and promoting Zakat and Wakf.

#### **4. Conclusion**
The Constitution of 1956 was a significant milestone as it broke the nine-year constitutional deadlock and transformed Pakistan from a dominion to a sovereign Islamic Republic. However, it was short-lived largely due to political instability, the lack of organized political parties, and the delay in general elections. It was abrogated on **7th October 1958** by President Iskander Mirza, leading to the imposition of Martial Law by General Ayub Khan, which marked a major turning point in Pakistan's political history.

**The Constitution of 1962**

**Introduction**
The Constitution of 1962 was the second constitution of Pakistan, promulgated by President Ayub Khan on **March 1, 1962**, and enforced on **June 8, 1962**. It was designed to legitimize the military regime and introduce a political system that Ayub Khan believed was better suited to Pakistan’s conditions than the parliamentary model. Unlike the 1956 Constitution, which was a consensus document, the 1962 Constitution was largely the product of a single individual's vision, establishing a highly centralized presidential system.

**Key Features and Detailed Explanation**

**1. Presidential Form of Government**
The most defining feature of the 1962 Constitution was the introduction of a Presidential system.
* **Head of State and Government:** The President was both the Head of State and the Chief Executive. The office of the Prime Minister was abolished.
* **Concentration of Power:** All executive authority was vested in the President. He had the power to appoint federal ministers, provincial governors, and judges. The legislature had very limited powers to check the President, leading critics to describe the system as a "Clock Tower" where all power radiated from one central point.
* **Veto Power:** The President had extensive veto powers over legislative bills passed by the National Assembly.

**2. Indirect Elections (Basic Democracies)**
Instead of direct universal suffrage, the constitution introduced a system of "Basic Democracies."
* **Electoral College:** The President and members of the National and Provincial Assemblies were elected indirectly by an Electoral College consisting of 80,000 "Basic Democrats" (40,000 from East Pakistan and 40,000 from West Pakistan).
* **Rationale:** The regime argued that the masses were illiterate and "unripe" for democracy, so they should only elect local representatives who would then choose higher officials.

**3. Unicameral Legislature**
The constitution established a unicameral (single-house) legislature known as the **National Assembly**.
* **Composition:** It consisted of 156 members initially (later increased), with equal representation (parity) given to East and West Pakistan, despite East Pakistan having a larger population.
* **Limited Powers:** The Assembly could not vote on the budget (except for new taxes), making it financially powerless compared to the Executive.

**4. Federal System with Strong Center**
While nominally a federal constitution, it created a highly centralized state.
* **Provincial Subordination:** Provincial Governors were appointed by the President and acted as his agents. They were not responsible to the provincial assemblies but to the President alone.
* **One Unit Scheme:** The "One Unit" system in West Pakistan (where all western provinces were merged into one) continued under this constitution to maintain parity with East Pakistan.

**5. Islamic Provisions**
The constitution retained the **Objective Resolution** as its preamble. Originally, the word "Islamic" was dropped from the country's name ("Republic of Pakistan"), but due to public pressure, the First Amendment restored it to the "Islamic Republic of Pakistan." It also established an **Advisory Council of Islamic Ideology** to ensure laws conformed to Islam.

**Conclusion**
The Constitution of 1962 failed to gain popular support because it was seen as a tool to perpetuate one-man rule. By denying the people the right to direct voting and suppressing provincial autonomy, it created deep resentment, particularly in East Pakistan. The system lacked checks and balances, and when mass agitation against Ayub Khan erupted in 1968-69, the constitutional machinery collapsed. On **March 25, 1969**, General Yahya Khan abrogated the constitution and imposed Martial Law, marking the end of Ayub Khan's "decade of development" and his political system.

## **Differentiation between 1962 and 1973 Constitutions**

***

### **Introduction**
A constitution is the supreme law of a state that outlines the fundamental political principles, procedures, powers, and duties of the government while establishing the rights of its citizens. In Pakistan's constitutional history, the **Constitution of 1962** and the **Constitution of 1973** represent two opposing philosophies of governance.

The 1962 Constitution, promulgated by **President Ayub Khan**, was designed to centralize power under a presidential system. In contrast, the 1973 Constitution, passed during **Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s** era, was a consensus document that established a federal parliamentary democracy, which remains in effect today.

---

### **Detailed Explanation: Differentiation between 1962 and 1973 Constitutions**

The following points highlight the fundamental differences between these two documents regarding the distribution of power, the structure of the legislature, and the rights of citizens.

#### **1. Form of Government (Presidential vs. Parliamentary)**
* **1962 Constitution:** It established a **Presidential form of government**. All executive authority was concentrated in the President, who was both the Head of State and the Head of Government. The Ministers were appointed by the President and were answerable only to him, not the legislature.
* **1973 Constitution:** It established a **Parliamentary form of government**. A clear distinction was made between the Head of State (President) and the Head of Government (Prime Minister). The Prime Minister holds the real executive power and is elected by the National Assembly, making them answerable to the Parliament.

#### **2. Structure of Legislature (Unicameral vs. Bicameral)**
* **1962 Constitution:** It introduced a **Unicameral Legislature** (one house), known as the National Assembly. It consisted of members elected equally from East and West Pakistan. There was no upper house (Senate) to represent the provinces equally.
* **1973 Constitution:** It introduced a **Bicameral Legislature** (two houses) consisting of:
    * **The National Assembly (Lower House):** Elected on the basis of population.
    * **The Senate (Upper House):** Elected on the basis of equal representation for all provinces, ensuring that smaller provinces like Balochistan have an equal voice compared to Punjab.

#### **3. Mode of Elections (Indirect vs. Direct)**
* **1962 Constitution:** It utilized an **Indirect System of Election**. The general public did not vote for the President or Assembly members directly. Instead, they elected 80,000 "Basic Democrats" (local councilors), who formed an electoral college to elect the President and the National Assembly.
* **1973 Constitution:** It restored the **Direct System of Election** based on universal adult franchise. Every citizen above the age of 18 (originally 21) has the right to vote directly for their representatives in the National and Provincial Assemblies.

#### **4. Nature of Federalism and Autonomy**
* **1962 Constitution:** While nominally federal, it was **highly centralized**. The Governors of provinces were appointed by the President and acted as his agents, leaving provinces with very little actual autonomy.
* **1973 Constitution:** It provided a **stronger Federal structure**. It contains a Federal Legislative List (powers of the center) and originally a Concurrent List (shared powers), with residuary powers vested in the provinces. This ensures greater provincial autonomy compared to 1962.

#### **5. Checks and Balances**
* **1962 Constitution:** There were **weak checks and balances**. The President had the power to dissolve the National Assembly, but the Assembly had very limited power to impeach the President (requiring a difficult 3/4 majority).
* **1973 Constitution:** There are **stronger checks and balances**. The Prime Minister can be removed via a Vote of No-Confidence. The President is a ceremonial head who acts on the advice of the Prime Minister.

---

### **Conclusion**
In summary, the **Constitution of 1962** was a rigid, one-man-centric document designed to support a military-bureaucratic rule through the "Basic Democracies" system. Conversely, the **Constitution of 1973** is a democratic, federal, and parliamentary document that reflects the popular will and ensures provincial harmony through the bicameral legislature. The 1973 Constitution's endurance lies in its creation by the elected representatives of the people, making it the only constitution in Pakistan's history to survive for over 50 years.

## **Differentiation between 1956 and 1973 Constitutions**

**Introduction**

A **constitution** is the supreme law of a state. It is a set of fundamental principles, established precedents, and legal rules that define how a country is governed. It outlines the structure of the state (executive, legislature, and judiciary), distributes powers among these institutions, and guarantees the fundamental rights of its citizens. In political science, it is often referred to as the "contract" between the state and its people, ensuring that the government exercises power within defined limits.

For Pakistan, constitutional development has been a journey of evolution. The **Constitution of 1956** was the country's first attempt to formalize its governance after nine years of independence, while the **Constitution of 1973** (currently in force) represents a consensus-based framework adopted after the separation of East Pakistan. Both documents envisaged a parliamentary system but differed significantly in their structural and operational details.

### **Detailed Explanation: The Constitutions of 1956 and 1973**

#### **1. The Constitution of 1956**
Adopted on 23rd March 1956, this constitution was a result of long deliberations and compromises, particularly regarding the representation of East and West Pakistan.
* **Structure:** It established a **unicameral legislature** (one house) based on the "One Unit" scheme, where West Pakistan was treated as a single province to create parity with East Pakistan.
* **Executive:** It provided for a Parliamentary form of government, but the President held significant discretionary powers, including the ability to dissolve the National Assembly, which contributed to political instability.
* **Fate:** It was abrogated in 1958 by President Iskander Mirza, leading to the first Martial Law.

#### **2. The Constitution of 1973**
Adopted on 14th August 1973, this constitution was drafted by a representative assembly after the loss of East Pakistan. It reflected a new political reality and a consensus among all major political parties.
* **Structure:** It established a **bicameral legislature** (two houses: National Assembly and Senate) to balance the population advantage of Punjab against the rights of smaller provinces.
* **Executive:** It established a stronger Parliamentary system where the Prime Minister is the chief executive with extensive powers, while the President is a ceremonial Head of State.
* **Fate:** Despite suspensions and amendments (notably the 8th and 17th amendments), it remains the supreme law of Pakistan today.

### **Differentiation between the Constitution of 1973 and 1956**

The following points highlight the critical structural and ideological differences between the two documents:

| Feature | Constitution of 1956 | Constitution of 1973 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Legislature** | **Unicameral:** Consisted of only one house (National Assembly). | **Bicameral:** Consists of two houses: The **Senate** (Upper House) and the **National Assembly** (Lower House). |
| **2. Representation** | **Parity Principle:** Seats were divided equally between East and West Pakistan (150 each), ignoring the population difference. | **Population & Equality:** National Assembly seats are based on population, while the Senate gives equal representation to all four provinces to ensure federal balance. |
| **3. Administrative Units** | **One Unit Scheme:** West Pakistan was merged into a single province to balance against East Pakistan. | **Four Provinces:** The Federation consists of four distinct provinces (Punjab, Sindh, KPK, Balochistan), respecting provincial autonomy. |
| **4. Executive Power** | **Strong President:** The President had the power to dissolve the assembly and dismiss the Prime Minister, often leading to instability. | **Strong Prime Minister:** The PM is the Chief Executive. The President acts on the advice of the PM and has limited powers to dissolve assemblies (especially after the 18th Amendment). |
| **5. National Language** | **Urdu and Bengali:** Both were declared national languages. | **Urdu:** Declared as the National Language, while English serves as the official language for administrative purposes. |
| **6. Islamic Provisions** | **Islamic Republic:** Declared Pakistan an Islamic Republic but was less specific on state religion. | **State Religion:** Article 2 explicitly declares **Islam as the State Religion**. It also defines a "Muslim" for legal purposes and mandates the Council of Islamic Ideology. |
| **7. Method of Amendment** | **Flexible:** Could be amended by a simple majority in some cases or a two-thirds majority of the single house. | **Rigid:** Requires a two-thirds majority in **both** houses (National Assembly and Senate) and presidential assent. |
| **8. Size & Detail** | Contained **234 Articles** and 6 Schedules. | More comprehensive, containing **280 Articles** and 7 Schedules. |

---

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, while both the 1956 and 1973 constitutions envisaged a federal parliamentary system for Pakistan, they differed fundamentally in their approach to federalism. The **1956 Constitution** relied on the artificial "One Unit" scheme and a unicameral house to manage the East-West disparity, which ultimately proved fragile. In contrast, the **1973 Constitution** introduced a bicameral legislature and a robust federal structure that acknowledged the distinct identity of the four provinces. This structural maturity, combined with a clearer definition of the executive's power and Islamic provisions, is why the 1973 Constitution has survived as the binding force of the federation for over five decades.
