**Subject: Principles of Policy (Articles 29-40) – Constitution of Pakistan 1973**

### **1. Introduction**
The **Principles of Policy** are contained in **Part II, Chapter 2** (Articles 29 to 40) of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973. While "Fundamental Rights" (Chapter 1) are legally enforceable by courts, the Principles of Policy serve as a constitutional framework and ethical guide for the state. They set the ideological direction for the government, outlining the socio-economic and political goals the state must strive to achieve.

Although these principles are **non-justiciable**—meaning a citizen cannot sue the state in court solely for failing to implement them immediately (due to resource constraints)—Article 29 mandates that it is the responsibility of every organ of the state to act in accordance with them.

### **3. Conclusion**
The Principles of Policy (Articles 29–40) represent the **"Manifesto of the State."** While they differ from Fundamental Rights in their enforceability, they are not merely ornamental. They impose a constitutional obligation on the President and Governors to submit annual reports to the assemblies regarding their implementation. Ideally, they guide Pakistan toward becoming a true Islamic Welfare State, balancing modern governance with Islamic values and social justice.
