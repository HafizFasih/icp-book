### **Question: Explain the Congress Ministries (1937–1939) and their impact on the Muslims of the Subcontinent.**

#### **Introduction**
The Congress Ministries were formed following the **Provincial Elections of 1937**, held under the Government of India Act 1935. The Indian National Congress secured a massive victory, winning absolute majorities in five provinces and forming governments in a total of eight (including Bombay, Bengal, and NWFP via coalitions). In contrast, the Muslim League performed poorly. The rule of the Congress from **July 1937 to October 1939** proved to be a turning point in Indian politics. It was characterized by policies that deeply alienated the Muslim population, convincing them that their rights would not be safe in a Hindu-dominated India, thereby accelerating the demand for a separate homeland.

#### **Detailed Explanation**

**1. Religious and Cultural Tyranny**
The most immediate source of friction was the Congress party's disregard for Muslim religious sentiments.
* **Bande Mataram:** The Congress government made the singing of *Bande Mataram* compulsory in provincial legislatures and schools. This song, taken from the novel *Anandamath*, contained anti-Muslim sentiments and encouraged the worship of the "Motherland" as a deity, which was idolatrous and unacceptable to Muslims.
* **Religious Restrictions:** Muslims faced severe restrictions on their religious practices. The slaughter of cows was banned in many areas, and severe restrictions were placed on the construction of new mosques. Loud music was often played outside mosques during prayer times to disturb worshippers, and the Congress police frequently sided with Hindu mobs during communal riots.

**2. Educational Policies and Language Imposition**
The educational reforms introduced by the Congress were seen as an attempt to erase Muslim identity and indoctrinate Muslim children with Hindu culture.
* **The Wardha Scheme:** Championed by Gandhi, this educational scheme emphasized manual labor (like spinning cotton) and required students to bow before Gandhi’s portrait. Religious education was removed from the curriculum, which Muslims feared would lead to the spiritual conversion of their youth.
* **Vidya Mandir Scheme:** Introduced in the Central Provinces (CP), this policy renamed schools "Vidya Mandirs" (Temples of Learning), further reinforcing Hindu cultural dominance.
* **Language Controversy:** The Congress aggressively promoted **Hindi** written in the Devanagri script as the official language, sidelining Urdu (the cultural lingua franca of Muslims). This threatened the literary and cultural heritage of the Muslim community.

**3. Political and Economic Discrimination**
Politically, the Congress acted with arrogance, refusing to form coalition governments with the Muslim League unless the League dissolved its parliamentary board and its members joined the Congress.
* This "absorptive" policy effectively meant the political elimination of the Muslim League.
* Economically, Muslims were systematically discriminated against in government jobs and the civil service. In many cases, Muslim officials were dismissed or bypassed for promotions in favor of Congress supporters. This administrative bias confirmed the "Hindu Raj" fears of Muslim leaders like Jinnah.

#### **Conclusion**
The Congress Ministries came to an abrupt end in **1939** when Congress resigned in protest against the Viceroy’s decision to involve India in World War II without consultation. The impact of their 27-month rule was profound. It exposed the "Ram Raj" mentality of the Congress and united the Muslims under the banner of the Muslim League. Quaid-e-Azam declared **22nd December 1939** as the **"Day of Deliverance"** to mark the end of this oppressive rule. Ultimately, the Congress Ministries justified the **Two-Nation Theory**, proving that a united India would result in permanent Hindu domination, paving the way for the Lahore Resolution in 1940.
