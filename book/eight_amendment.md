### **The 8th Amendment (1985)**

**Introduction**
The 8th Amendment to the Constitution of 1973 was passed in November 1985. It is widely considered one of the most controversial constitutional changes in Pakistan's history. Enacted during the regime of General Zia-ul-Haq, this amendment was the price the newly elected non-party Parliament had to pay for the lifting of Martial Law. It fundamentally altered the parliamentary nature of the 1973 Constitution, shifting the balance of power heavily in favor of the President and effectively creating a semi-presidential system.

**Detailed Explanation**

**1. Article 58(2)(b) – The Power of Dissolution:**
The most critical and contentious aspect of the 8th Amendment was the addition of Article 58(2)(b). This clause empowered the President to dissolve the National Assembly at his own discretion if, in his opinion, "a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution."
* **Significance:** This provision acted as a "Sword of Damocles" over elected governments. It allowed an indirectly elected President to dismiss a directly elected Prime Minister and Parliament.
* **Historical Usage:** This power was ruthlessly used to destabilize the political system. It was invoked to dismiss the governments of Muhammad Khan Junejo (1988), Benazir Bhutto (1990 and 1996), and Nawaz Sharif (1993).

**2. Indemnity Clause (Article 270-A):**
The amendment provided a blanket constitutional cover to General Zia's military regime. Through Article 270-A, all laws, orders, and martial law regulations passed between July 5, 1977 (when Zia took power), and 1985 were validated. Parliament could not challenge the legality of the military takeover or the actions taken during the Martial Law period.

**3. Shift in Executive Authority:**
The 8th Amendment weakened the position of the Prime Minister. Before this, the President was largely a ceremonial head of state bound by the advice of the Prime Minister. The amendment changed Article 48, allowing the President to act in his discretion in respect of any matter where he was empowered by the Constitution. This created a dyarchy where power was shared between the President and the Prime Minister, often leading to institutional clashes.

**4. Changes to the Senate:**
The amendment also altered the structure of the Senate (the Upper House). The term of Senators was increased from four to six years. This was done to ensure continuity and stability in the legislative process, making the Senate a permanent body that could not be dissolved like the National Assembly.

**Conclusion**
The 8th Amendment had a lasting negative impact on democracy in Pakistan. By legitimizing a military dictator's actions and handing the President the unilateral power to dissolve assemblies, it derailed the parliamentary spirit of the 1973 Constitution. The amendment ushered in a decade of political instability (1988–1999) where no elected Prime Minister could complete their term. It was eventually repealed by the 13th Amendment in 1997 (by Nawaz Sharif) and later the 18th Amendment in 2010, which finally restored the supremacy of the Parliament.
