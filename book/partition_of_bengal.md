### **Introduction**
The Partition of Bengal in **1905** was a pivotal event in the history of the Subcontinent that significantly altered the political landscape of British India. It was implemented by the Viceroy, **Lord Curzon**, who divided the largest province of India into two separate administrative units: **West Bengal** and **East Bengal & Assam**. While the British claimed this was purely an administrative necessity due to the province's massive size, it was widely perceived by Indians—particularly Hindus—as a "Divide and Rule" tactic. This event is historically significant as it crystallized the political differences between Hindus and Muslims, eventually leading to the formation of the All India Muslim League.

### **Detailed Explanation**

**1. Reasons for Partition**
The primary reason cited by the British was **administrative efficiency**. Bengal was a massive province with a population of **85 million**, covering Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. It was deemed too large for a single Lieutenant Governor to administer effectively. Lord Curzon argued that the eastern districts were neglected and under-governed.
* **Socio-Economic Disparity:** The western part of Bengal (centered around Calcutta) was developed and industrialized, while the eastern part (East Bengal) was agrarian and backward. The partition aimed to develop East Bengal by giving it a separate administration and a new capital at **Dacca** (Dhaka) and a port at Chittagong.
* **Political Motives:** Historians argue that the underlying British motive was to weaken the **Indian National Congress** and the growing force of Bengali nationalism. By dividing the province, the British hoped to fracture the unity of the Bengali people along religious lines.

**2. The New Provinces**
On **16th October 1905**, the partition came into effect:
* **West Bengal:** Included Bihar and Orissa. It was a Hindu-majority province with **Calcutta** as its capital.
* **East Bengal and Assam:** Included the divisions of Dhaka, Chittagong, and Rajshahi. It was a Muslim-majority province with **Dacca** as its capital.

**3. Muslim Reaction (Approval)**
The Muslims of Bengal **welcomed** the partition with great relief and joy.
* **Liberation from Dominance:** For decades, Muslim peasants in the east had been economically oppressed by Hindu landlords and merchants from Calcutta. They saw the new province as a liberation from this economic stranglehold.
* **Political & Social Opportunities:** The new province meant that Muslims would be the majority. They hoped this would lead to better education, government jobs, and political representation, which had previously been monopolized by the educationally advanced Hindus.

**4. Hindu Reaction (Opposition)**
The Hindus, led by the Indian National Congress, strongly **opposed** the partition.
* **"Divide and Rule":** They viewed it as a deliberate British attempt to divide the Bengali nation and weaken the nationalist movement.
* **Swadeshi Movement:** The reaction turned violent and organized. The **Swadeshi Movement** was launched, urging people to boycott British goods and use local products. The 16th of October was observed as a "Day of Mourning."
* **Terrorist Activities:** Protests escalated into civil unrest, and there was a rise in revolutionary activities, including an assassination attempt on the Viceroy.

**5. Annulment of Partition (1911)**
Due to the relentless protests, economic pressure from the Swadeshi boycott, and the threat of rising violence, the British government eventually capitulated. In **1911**, **King George V** announced the **Annulment of the Partition of Bengal** at the Delhi Durbar. The two parts of Bengal were reunited, and the capital of India was shifted from Calcutta to Delhi to reduce Bengali political influence.

### **Conclusion**
The Partition of Bengal and its subsequent annulment was a watershed moment for Indian Muslims. While the partition initially offered them hope of economic and political, its annulment left them feeling betrayed by the British government. They realized that the British could not be trusted to protect their interests against Hindu agitation and that the Indian National Congress primarily represented Hindu interests. This realization directly led to the formation of the **All India Muslim League in 1906** and the demand for separate electorates, setting the stage for the eventual demand for a separate homeland, Pakistan.
