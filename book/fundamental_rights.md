**Question:** Explain the fundamental rights of Pakistan as outlined in Articles 8–25 of the Constitution.

### Introduction
Fundamental Rights are the basic human rights guaranteed to every citizen of a state, ensuring their liberty, dignity, and equality. In the **Constitution of Pakistan 1973**, these rights are enshrined in **Part II, Chapter 1 (Articles 8–28)**. They are considered "justiciable," meaning that if the state violates these rights, a citizen can approach the High Court (under Article 199) or the Supreme Court (under Article 184(3)) for enforcement. These articles form the bedrock of democracy in Pakistan, limiting the power of the state and protecting the individual from tyranny.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, Articles 8–25 of the 1973 Constitution provide a comprehensive framework for the protection of human rights in Pakistan. By covering aspects ranging from physical security and civil liberties to religious freedom and equality, the Constitution aims to create a welfare state where the rule of law prevails. The inclusion of rights like the **Right to Fair Trial (10-A)**, **Right to Information (19-A)**, and **Right to Education (25-A)** through amendments reflects the evolving nature of the Constitution to meet modern democratic standards. It is the duty of the judiciary to ensure these rights are not just theoretical, but practically available to every citizen.
