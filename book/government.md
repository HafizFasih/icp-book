**Q: Describe the structure of the Government of Pakistan and its components (Legislative, Executive, Judiciary) in detail.**

### **Introduction**
The Islamic Republic of Pakistan functions as a **federal parliamentary republic** defined by the **Constitution of 1973**. The state’s authority is distributed among three distinct but interconnected branches: the **Legislature** (which makes laws), the **Executive** (which enforces laws), and the **Judiciary** (which interprets laws). This separation of powers is designed to ensure checks and balances, with the Constitution acting as the supreme law of the land.

### **1. The Legislative Branch (Parliament / Majlis-e-Shoora)**
The legislative authority is vested in a bicameral legislature known as the **Majlis-e-Shoora** (Parliament). It consists of the President and two Houses: the National Assembly and the Senate.

* **The President (as part of Parliament):** While primarily the Head of State, the President is technically part of the Parliament. Their assent is required for a Bill to become an Act (Law), though their power to reject bills is limited by the Constitution.
* **The National Assembly (Lower House):**
    * **Representation:** It represents the *population* of Pakistan.
    * **Composition:** It currently has **336 members**. This includes **266 general seats** elected directly by the people through universal adult suffrage, **60 seats reserved for women**, and **10 seats for non-Muslims** (filled via proportional representation based on party strength).
    * **Term:** The tenure is **5 years** unless dissolved earlier.
    * **Function:** It has the exclusive power to pass **Money Bills** (Budget). It also elects the Prime Minister.
* **The Senate (Upper House):**
    * **Representation:** It represents the *provinces* equally to prevent the domination of more populous provinces (like Punjab) over smaller ones.
    * **Composition:** It has **96 members**. Each Provincial Assembly elects **23 members** (14 general, 4 women, 4 technocrats, 1 minority). Islamabad has 4 members.
    * **Term:** Senators serve a **6-year term**, with half the Senate retiring every 3 years (permanent house; it cannot be dissolved).
    * **Function:** It reviews legislation passed by the Lower House but cannot vote on Money Bills.

### **2. The Executive Branch**
The Executive branch is responsible for the daily administration of the state and the implementation of laws. It is divided into the Head of State and the Head of Government.

* **The President (Head of State):**
    * **Role:** The ceremonial head of the state representing the unity of the Republic.
    * **Election:** Elected indirectly by an Electoral College (Senate, National Assembly, and Provincial Assemblies) for a **5-year term**.
    * **Powers:** acts on the advice of the Prime Minister. Key powers include granting pardons, appointing the Chiefs of Armed Forces (on PM's advice), and promulgating ordinances when Parliament is not in session.
* **The Prime Minister (Head of Government):**
    * **Role:** The Chief Executive of the Federation who holds the real executive power.
    * **Election:** Elected by the majority vote of the National Assembly.
    * **Powers:** Heads the **Federal Cabinet**, formulates policy, manages the economy, and oversees the civil bureaucracy. The PM is answerable to the Parliament.
* **The Federal Cabinet:**
    * Comprises Federal Ministers and Ministers of State appointed by the President on the advice of the PM. They head various ministries (e.g., Finance, Defense, Interior) and aid the PM in governance.
* **Civil Services:**
    * A permanent bureaucracy (e.g., Secretaries, Commissioners) that assists the political executive in implementing policies and running administrative machinery.

### **3. The Judicial Branch**
The Judiciary is the guardian of the Constitution, responsible for interpreting laws and protecting fundamental rights. It acts independently of the Executive.

* **Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) / Supreme Court (SC):**
    * *Note on Structure:* Under the traditional structure, the **Supreme Court of Pakistan** is the apex court. However, recent constitutional amendments (26th/27th Amendments) have introduced the **Federal Constitutional Court** to handle constitutional interpretation specifically, while the Supreme Court focuses on civil and criminal appeals.
    * **Supreme Court:** Located in Islamabad, headed by the **Chief Justice of Pakistan**. It has original, appellate, and advisory jurisdiction. It hears appeals from High Courts.
    * **Federal Shariat Court:** Examines whether laws are repugnant to the injunctions of Islam (Quran and Sunnah).
* **High Courts:**
    * Each of the four provinces has a High Court (Lahore, Sindh, Peshawar, Balochistan) plus the Islamabad High Court. They are the highest judicial bodies in their respective provinces.
* **Subordinate Judiciary:**
    * **District & Sessions Courts:** Operate in every district to handle civil and criminal cases.
    * **Special Courts:** Tribunals for specific issues like Banking, Anti-Terrorism, and Accountability.

### **Conclusion**
The government structure of Pakistan is a federal parliamentary system designed to balance power between the center and provinces (via the Senate) and between the state organs (Legislature, Executive, Judiciary). While the **Legislature** creates the law and the **Executive** implements it, the **Judiciary** ensures that both operate within the limits of the Constitution, theoretically ensuring the rule of law and democratic stability in the country.
