### **The Objective Resolution (1949)**

#### **1. Introduction**
The Objective Resolution is one of the most significant documents in the constitutional history of Pakistan. It was moved by the first Prime Minister, **Liaquat Ali Khan**, and was passed by the Constituent Assembly on **March 12, 1949**. This resolution laid the foundation for the future constitutions of the country by outlining the fundamental principles and ideology upon which the state of Pakistan would be governed. It is often referred to as the "Magna Carta" of Pakistan's constitutional history because it resolved the early conflict regarding the ideological direction of the new state.

#### **2. Main Features of the Resolution**
The resolution provided a broad framework for the state's operations. Its key features are as follows:

* **Sovereignty of Allah:** The resolution began with the declaration that sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to **Allah Almighty alone**. It clarified that the authority exercised by the people of Pakistan is a sacred trust and must be exercised within the limits prescribed by Him.
* **Delegated Authority:** It established that the state would exercise its powers and authority through the chosen representatives of the people. This affirmed the democratic nature of the state, ensuring that governance was not the right of a specific individual or family but of the elected representatives.
* **Islamic Principles:** The resolution mandated that the principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance, and social justice, as enunciated by Islam, would be fully observed. This distinguished Pakistan’s democracy as one guided by Islamic ethics rather than secular Western models alone.
* **Muslim Way of Life:** It ensured that Muslims would be enabled to order their lives, both individually and collectively, in accordance with the teachings and requirements of Islam as set out in the **Holy Quran and Sunnah**.
* **Protection of Minorities:** Despite being an Islamic state, the resolution explicitly guaranteed adequate provision for minorities to freely profess and practice their religions and develop their cultures. It ensured that their legitimate interests and fundamental rights would be safeguarded.
* **Federal System:** The resolution decided that Pakistan would be a Federation, where the constituent units (provinces) would be autonomous within the limits defined by the constitution.
* **Fundamental Rights:** It guaranteed fundamental rights to all citizens, including equality of status, equality of opportunity, equality before the law, and freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, worship, and association.
* **Independence of the Judiciary:** The document emphasized that the independence of the judiciary would be fully secured, ensuring that justice would be dispensed without fear or pressure from the executive.

#### **3. Conclusion**
In conclusion, the Objective Resolution was a landmark achievement that defined the ideological identity of Pakistan. It successfully blended the concepts of modern democracy with the principles of Islam, aiming to create a welfare state. Its importance is evident from the fact that it served as the preamble for the Constitutions of 1956, 1962, and 1973, and was later made a substantive part of the Constitution of 1973 via the **Eighth Amendment** in 1985 (Article 2A).
