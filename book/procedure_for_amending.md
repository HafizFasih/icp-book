### **Introduction**
The Constitution of Pakistan (1973) is classified as a **rigid constitution**, meaning it cannot be altered by a simple majority like ordinary laws. The framers intentionally made the amendment process difficult to ensure political stability and protect the rights of the federating units (provinces). The specific procedure for amending the constitution is enshrined in **Part XI, Articles 238 and 239**. Article 238 grants Parliament the power to amend the constitution, while Article 239 details the specific legislative steps required to do so.

### **Detailed Procedure for Amendment**

The process of amending the Constitution of Pakistan involves the following distinct stages:

**1. Initiation of the Bill (Article 239-1)**
Unlike Money Bills, which must originate in the National Assembly, a Constitutional Amendment Bill can originate in **either House** of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament)—the National Assembly or the Senate.

**2. Approval by the First House**
Once the bill is introduced in the House of origin, it must be passed by a **two-thirds majority** of the **total membership** of that House.
* *Note:* It is not enough to have two-thirds of the members *present* on that day; it must be two-thirds of the *total* seats existing in the House.

**3. Transmission to the Second House**
After being passed by the first House, the bill is transmitted to the other House. The second House also debates the bill and must pass it with the same **two-thirds majority** of its total membership.

**4. Handling Disagreements (No Joint Sitting)**
* **If passed without amendment:** If the second House passes the bill exactly as it was received, it is ready for Presidential assent.
* **If passed with amendment:** If the second House introduces changes, the bill is sent back to the originating House. The originating House must then reconsider the bill and pass the *amended* version by a two-thirds majority.
* **Deadlock:** Unlike ordinary laws, there is **no provision for a Joint Sitting** of Parliament to resolve a deadlock on a Constitutional Amendment. If the second House rejects the bill, or if the houses cannot agree, the amendment bill dies.

**5. Special Provision: Altering Provincial Limits (Article 239-4)**
The Constitution includes a specific safeguard for provincial autonomy. If an amendment bill seeks to **alter the limits (boundaries)** of a province, it cannot be presented to the President for assent unless it has been passed by the **Provincial Assembly** of that specific province. This passage also requires a **two-thirds majority** of the Provincial Assembly's total membership.

**6. Presidential Assent (Article 239-2)**
Once the bill has been passed by both Houses (and the Provincial Assembly, if applicable), it is presented to the President for assent.
* Under Article 239, the President **shall assent** to the bill.
* Unlike ordinary bills, the President has **no power to return** a Constitutional Amendment Bill to Parliament for reconsideration. The assent is mandatory and effectively a formality once Parliament has spoken.

### **Conclusion**
In conclusion, the procedure for amending the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan reflects the federal nature of the state. By requiring a **two-thirds majority** in both the National Assembly (representing the population) and the Senate (representing the provinces equally), the Constitution ensures that no single political party or province can unilaterally alter the supreme law of the land. This rigorous process serves as a vital check and balance, preserving the democratic and federal character of Pakistan.
