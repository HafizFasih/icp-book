### **The Urdu-Hindi Controversy (1867)**

#### **1. Introduction**
The Urdu-Hindi Controversy of 1867 was a significant event in the history of the Subcontinent that sowed the early seeds of the **Two-Nation Theory**. It began in **Banaras (Varanasi)** when prominent Hindu leaders demanded that Urdu, written in the Persian script, be replaced by Hindi, written in the Devanagari script, as the official language of the courts. This was the first time linguistic differences were used to create a political divide between Hindus and Muslims, marking a turning point in Hindu-Muslim relations.

#### **2. Detailed Explanation**

**A. Historical Background & The Spark**
* **1837 Policy:** In 1837, the British government replaced Persian with **Urdu** as the official court language of the North-Western Provinces. For decades, both Hindus and Muslims accepted this, as Urdu was a language of the masses (lingua franca) developed through the interaction of both communities.
* **The Agitation (1867):** The controversy formally erupted in 1867 in Banaras. Hindu leaders, such as **Babu Shiva Prasad**, began agitating for the removal of Urdu. They argued that the Urdu script (Perso-Arabic) was foreign and difficult, whereas Hindi in the Devanagari script was indigenous and easier for the Hindu majority to read.
* **Underlying Motive:** Muslims viewed this demand not merely as a linguistic preference but as an attack on their cultural heritage. They believed that eliminating Urdu was a calculated move to marginalize Muslims from government jobs and erase their history.

**B. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan’s Transformation**
* Before 1867, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was a strong advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity, often describing the two communities as the "two eyes of a beautiful bride."
* However, the anti-Urdu aggression in Banaras shocked him. It was during this time that he spoke his famous words to **Mr. Shakespeare**, the Divisional Commissioner of Banaras:
    > *"I am now convinced that these two nations will not join whole-heartedly in anything. At present, there is no open hostility between the two communities, but on account of the so-called 'educated' people, it will increase immensely in the future."*
* This statement is often cited by historians as the **first clear articulation of the Two-Nation Theory**, as Sir Syed realized that if Hindus and Muslims could not even agree on a common language, they could not function as a single political nation.

**C. Escalation and the Urdu Defence Society (1900)**
* The controversy flared up again in **1900** when **Sir Anthony MacDonnell**, the Governor of the United Provinces (UP), issued an order granting equal official status to Hindi.
* This led to immediate protests by Muslims. **Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk** (a close associate of Sir Syed) formed the **Urdu Defence Society** to protect the language. His aggressive defense of Urdu angered the British administration but solidified political mobilization among Muslims.

#### **3. Conclusion**
The Urdu-Hindi Controversy was far more than a dispute over scripts; it was a clash of civilizations and identities. It served as an eye-opener for Muslim leaders like Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, convincing them that Hindu and Muslim interests were becoming increasingly divergent. This linguistic conflict laid the **foundation for Muslim separatism**, eventually evolving into the political demand for a separate homeland, Pakistan.
