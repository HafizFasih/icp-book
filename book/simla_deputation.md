The Simla Deputation of 1906 is a landmark event in the history of the Pakistan Movement.

### **Introduction**
The Simla Deputation refers to a delegation of **35 prominent Muslim leaders**, led by **Sir Aga Khan III**, who met the Viceroy of India, **Lord Minto**, at Simla on **October 1, 1906**. The primary objective of this mission was to secure separate political rights and safeguards for the Muslim community in anticipation of the upcoming constitutional reforms (later known as the Minto-Morley Reforms). This event represents the first systematic attempt by Muslims to present their demands to the British government on a constitutional platform.

### **Detailed Explanation**

**1. Background and Factors Leading to the Deputation:**
* **The Hindi-Urdu Controversy:** The aggressive campaign by Hindus to replace Urdu with Hindi in government offices (starting in 1867) convinced Muslim leaders that their cultural heritage was under threat in a Hindu-majority India.
* **Partisan Attitude of Congress:** The Indian National Congress claimed to represent all Indians, but its support for the anti-partition of Bengal agitation (1905) and Hindi-only policies made it clear to Muslims that the party primarily served Hindu interests.
* **Impending Reforms:** When the Liberal Party came to power in Britain, they announced their intention to introduce constitutional reforms in India to increase local representation. Muslims feared that under a joint electorate system, they would be permanently outvoted by the Hindu majority.

**2. Key Demands Presented:**
The deputation presented an address (memorial) drafted by Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk and others, which included the following critical demands:
* **Separate Electorates:** The most significant demand was that Muslims should be allowed to elect their own representatives through separate constituencies. This was to ensure genuine Muslim representation.
* **Weightage:** They demanded that the number of Muslim seats in the councils should not be determined solely by their numerical population but also by their political importance and historical contribution to the defense of the Empire.
* **Government Service Quotas:** A demand was made for a fair share of jobs for Muslims in the civil services and judiciary.
* **Representation in Universities:** They asked for Muslim representation in the syndicates and senates of universities and for aid in upgrading MAO College to a university.

**3. Lord Minto's Response:**
Lord Minto gave a very encouraging and sympathetic response. He assured the delegation that the political rights and interests of the Muslim community would be safeguarded in any administrative reorganization. He acknowledged the validity of the argument that "numerical strength" alone should not be the basis of representation in a heterogeneous society like India.

### **Conclusion**
The Simla Deputation was a phenomenal success. Its immediate result was the inclusion of **Separate Electorates** in the **Minto-Morley Reforms of 1909**, which legally recognized Muslims as a distinct political entity. This acceptance validated the **Two-Nation Theory** constitutionally and provided the impetus for the formation of the **All India Muslim League** in December 1906. It laid the foundation for the separatist movement that eventually led to the creation of Pakistan.
