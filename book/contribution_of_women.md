# Contributions of women in the Pakistan Movement

## Bi Amma (Abadi Bano Begum)

**Introduction**
The role of women in the Pakistan Movement is often described as the "backbone" of the struggle for independence. While the political stage was largely dominated by men, Muslim women played a pivotal role in mobilizing the masses, spreading political consciousness, and sustaining the momentum of the freedom struggle from within the domestic sphere to the public streets. Among these trailblazers, **Bi Amma (Abadi Bano Begum)** stands as a towering figure. Although she passed away before the Lahore Resolution of 1940, her contributions during the Khilafat Movement (1919–1924) laid the foundational groundwork for Muslim women's political awakening in the Subcontinent, setting a precedent for the activism of later leaders like Fatima Jinnah and Begum Ra’ana Liaquat Ali Khan.

**Detailed Explanation**

**1. The "Mother" of the Freedom Struggle:**
Bi Amma’s most immediate contribution was her role as the mother and mentor of the famous **Ali Brothers** (Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar and Maulana Shaukat Ali). Widowed at a young age, she defied the conservative norms of her time by pawning her jewelry to ensure her sons received a modern English education at Aligarh and Oxford, alongside their religious training. She instilled in them a fearless spirit of anti-imperialism, effectively gifting the nation two of its most fiery leaders. Her maternity was political; she viewed her sons not as personal assets but as a trust (*amanat*) for the cause of Islam and freedom.

**2. Leadership in the Khilafat Movement:**
When the Ali Brothers were imprisoned by the British in 1917 and later during the Khilafat Movement, a leadership vacuum emerged. Bi Amma stepped into this void, becoming the first Muslim woman to actively participate in mainstream politics.
* **Public Mobilization:** Despite her advanced age and poor health, she toured the length and breadth of India, addressing large gatherings. Her presence electrified the masses, as it was unprecedented for a conservative Muslim woman to command public platforms.
* **Fundraising:** She played a critical role in collecting funds for the Khilafat Committee and the Angora Fund (for Turkey), urging women to donate their jewelry for the national cause.

**3. The Famous Call for Sacrifice:**
Bi Amma is immortalized in history for her unwavering resolve. When it was rumored that the British would release her sons if they apologized, she vehemently declared that her "old hands would strangle them" if they ever compromised with the colonial rulers. Her sentiment was captured in the famous verse that became a rallying cry for millions:
> *"Boli Amma Muhammad Ali se, jaan beta Khilafat pe de do."*
> (Amma said to Muhammad Ali, give your life for the sake of the Khilafat.)

This slogan galvanized the Muslim youth, framing the political struggle as a religious and moral duty worth dying for.

**4. Breaking Social Taboos:**
Bi Amma was instrumental in bringing Muslim women out of strict seclusion (*purdah*) for political activism. While she herself maintained the *burqa*, she addressed mixed gatherings of men, famously lifting her face veil in a meeting to declare that all freedom fighters were her sons, and thus she did not need to veil from them. This symbolic act broke the psychological barrier for Muslim women, encouraging them to attend protests, hold meetings, and participate in the political destiny of their nation.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, Bi Amma’s contributions were the spark that ignited the flame of political activism among Muslim women in the Subcontinent. She transformed the traditional role of a mother into a powerful political force, proving that the domestic sphere could be a launchpad for revolution. Her fearlessness, sacrifice, and ability to mobilize the masses paved the way for the active participation of women in the Muslim League during the 1940s. Without the awakening she spearheaded in the 1920s, the mass mobilization of women in the final phase of the Pakistan Movement would have been far more difficult to achieve.

## Fatima Jinnah

### **Introduction**
Fatima Jinnah, revered as *Madar-e-Millat* (Mother of the Nation), stands as one of the most pivotal figures in the Pakistan Movement. While many women contributed to the struggle for independence, Fatima Jinnah's role was unique and multidimensional. She served not only as the primary confidante and advisor to Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah but also as the architect of political awakening among Muslim women in the Subcontinent. Her contributions were instrumental in transforming the All India Muslim League (AIML) into a mass movement that included the female half of the Muslim population.

### **Constant Companion and Advisor to the Quaid**
One of Fatima Jinnah's most significant contributions was her unwavering support for her brother, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. After the death of Jinnah’s wife in 1929, Fatima Jinnah abandoned her successful dental practice to manage his household and become his constant companion. For nearly 28 years, she accompanied him to almost every public appearance, political rally, and strategic meeting.
* **Emotional and Logistical Support:** During the critical years of the movement (1940–1947), Jinnah’s health was deteriorating. Fatima Jinnah shielded him from unnecessary burdens, managed his appointments, and provided the emotional stability he needed to lead the nation. Jinnah famously acknowledged her support, stating, "My sister was like a bright ray of light and hope whenever I came back home and met her."
* **Political Counsel:** She was not merely a silent observer but an astute political advisor. She was privy to the most sensitive political discussions and often acted as a sounding board for the Quaid's ideas, ensuring he remained focused on the goal of Pakistan despite immense political pressure from the Congress and the British.

### **Mobilization and Political Organization of Women**
Fatima Jinnah is credited with institutionalizing women's role in Muslim politics. Before her active intervention, Muslim women in India were largely largely excluded from the political sphere due to strict social customs.
* **Women’s Wing of the Muslim League:** In **1938**, at the Patna Session of the All India Muslim League, the **All India Muslim Women’s Sub-Committee** was formed, and Fatima Jinnah was appointed its Convener. This was a watershed moment that integrated women into the party structure. She established provincial and district-level committees, creating a disciplined network of women workers across the Subcontinent.
* **Student Mobilization:** Recognizing the power of youth, she founded the **All India Muslim Women Students Federation** in Delhi in **February 1941**. This organization radicalized young female students, who later played a crucial role in spreading the message of Pakistan to rural areas where men could not easily enter.

### **Role in the 1945-46 Elections and Independence**
Her leadership was most visible during the crucial **1945-46 general elections**, which were a referendum on the demand for Pakistan.
* **Election Campaign:** Fatima Jinnah toured the Subcontinent extensively, addressing rallies and urging women to vote. She framed the vote as a "sacred trust" and successfully mobilized conservative Muslim women to break social taboos and visit polling stations. This mass turnout was decisive in the Muslim League's victory, proving that the demand for Pakistan had universal support among Muslims.
* **Civil Disobedience and Relief Work:** During the active phases of the movement, such as the Civil Disobedience Movement in Punjab (1947), she guided women leaders to stage protests and face arrests. Furthermore, immediately after Partition, she formed the **Women’s Relief Committee** (which later evolved into the All Pakistan Women’s Association or APWA nucleus) to handle the massive influx of refugees, setting a precedent for social welfare in the new state.

### **Conclusion**
In conclusion, Fatima Jinnah’s contribution to the Pakistan Movement was foundational. She did not just support the leader of the movement; she created a parallel force of women activists who became the backbone of the Muslim League’s street-level agitation. By bringing women out of their homes and into the political arena, she ensured that the demand for Pakistan was a truly national struggle. Her legacy as *Madar-e-Millat* is a testament to her lifelong dedication to the creation and development of Pakistan.

## Begum Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan.

### Introduction
The contributions of women to the Pakistan Movement were pivotal, marking a significant shift from traditional seclusion to active political mobilization. While early efforts were limited to moral support, by the 1940s, Muslim women had become a formidable political force. They played a crucial role in spreading the ideology of the Muslim League, participating in civil disobedience, and managing relief operations. Key figures like Fatima Jinnah, Begum Salma Tasadduq Hussain, and notably Begum Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan, provided the leadership and organizational structure necessary to rally the female population behind the demand for a separate homeland.

### General Contributions of Women
Women served as the backbone of the movement's social and political campaigns. Their involvement began to crystallize during the Khilafat Movement with figures like Bi Amma, who encouraged women to participate in politics even from behind the veil. However, the real surge occurred in the 1940s under the guidance of Quaid-e-Azam, who established the Women’s National Guard.
* **Political Mobilization:** Women actively campaigned during the vital 1945-46 elections. In the Punjab, they organized demonstrations against the Unionist government and the Khizar Ministry. Their ability to enter homes and educate other women on the importance of the Muslim League was instrumental in securing the "women's vote," which was decisive in the League's victory.
* **Civil Disobedience:** During the height of the movement, women defied Section 144, faced tear gas, and even climbed the Punjab Secretariat to hoist the Muslim League flag, proving their commitment to the cause was equal to that of men.

### The Role of Begum Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan
Begum Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan stands out as one of the most intellectually and organizationally gifted leaders of the movement. Her contributions went beyond mere participation; she provided the movement with logistical and economic expertise.
* **Economic & Strategic Support:** Before partition, she served as an honorary treasurer and economic advisor to the Pakistan Movement Committee. As an educated economist (holding a Master's in Economics), she helped organize the financial aspects of the League’s activities, a rare and vital contribution for a woman at the time.
* **Organization of Relief and Defense:** In 1942, fearing Japanese attacks during WWII, Jinnah asked her to train women in first aid. She established a small volunteer medical corps in Delhi. This experience became critical in 1947 during the massive migration. She founded the **Pakistan Women’s National Guard (PWNG)** and the **Pakistan Women’s Naval Reserve (PWNR)**, personally holding the rank of Brigadier. These organizations trained women in nursing, typing, and signaling to support the newly formed state.
* **Refugee Rehabilitation:** Immediately following independence, she organized the **Women’s Voluntary Service (WVS)** to manage the horrific refugee crisis. She mobilized women to come out of their homes to cook, clean, and nurse the millions of refugees pouring into camps like Walton, effectively managing a humanitarian disaster that the new government could not handle alone.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the success of the Pakistan Movement was heavily reliant on the active participation of women who expanded the Muslim League's reach into the domestic sphere and stood firm on the front lines of protests. Begum Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan’s specific contributions were unique; she did not just lead crowds but built the institutions and organizational frameworks (like the WVS and PWNG) that allowed women to contribute tangibly to the state’s creation and survival. Her legacy, solidified by the later formation of APWA, proves that women were not just supporters but architects of Pakistan.
