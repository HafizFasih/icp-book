# Government Structure of Pakistan

## Introduction

The **Islamic Republic of Pakistan** works as a **federal parliamentary republic** as written in the **Constitution of 1973**. The state's power is divided among three different but connected branches: the **Legislature** (makes laws), the **Executive** (carries out laws), and the **Judiciary** (explains laws).

This **separation of powers** ensures checks and balances, with the Constitution as the highest law of the land. This design stops power from gathering in one place and protects basic rights while keeping the government stable.

---

## 1. The Legislative Branch (Parliament / Majlis-e-Shoora)

### Overview

The law-making power belongs to a **two-house legislature** called the **Majlis-e-Shoora** (Council of Consultation). The Parliament has the President and two Houses: the **National Assembly** and the **Senate**.

### Parliamentary Structure

```
MAJLIS-E-SHOORA (PARLIAMENT)
│
├── The President (Constitutional Head)
│   └── Ceremonial Role in Legislation

│   ├── 60 Reserved for Women
│   └── 10 Reserved for Non-Muslims
│       Total: 336 Members
│
└── SENATE (Upper House)
    ├── 23 Members per Province (4 provinces)
    ├── 4 Members from Islamabad
    └── Total: 96 Members
```

### The President (as part of Parliament)

The President is mainly the Head of State and is also part of Parliament. Their approval is needed for a Bill to become a Law, though their power to reject bills is limited by the Constitution.

**Key Functions:**
- Gives approval to laws
- Acts as ceremonial leader
- Can send bills back for another look (limited veto power)

### The National Assembly (Lower House)

#### **Representation & Composition**

The National Assembly represents the **population** of Pakistan.

:::note Important
The National Assembly is more powerful than the Senate because it represents the people directly and controls financial matters—the lifeblood of government.
:::

### The Senate (Upper House)

#### **Representation & Composition**

The Senate represents the **provinces equally** to prevent the domination of more populous provinces (like Punjab) over smaller ones.

| **Type** | Lower House | Upper House |

## Separation of Powers and Checks & Balances

### Fundamental Principle

The **doctrine of separation of powers** ensures that no single branch becomes too powerful. Each branch is independent but has mechanisms to check the others.

### Legislative Checks on Executive

| Check | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **No-Confidence Motion** | Can remove PM/government by majority vote |
| **Budget Approval** | National Assembly controls budget and taxation |
| **Legislation** | Can pass laws to restrain executive action |
| **Parliamentary Questions** | Cabinet answerable to Parliament |
| **Committees** | Parliamentary committees investigate executive actions |
| **Constitutional Amendment** | Can amend Constitution (with supermajority) |

### Executive Checks on Legislature

| Check | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Veto Power** | President (on PM's advice) returns bills for reconsideration |
| **Ordinance Power** | PM advises President to issue ordinances when Parliament not in session |
| **Dissolution** | PM can advise President to dissolve National Assembly |
| **Agenda Control** | Controls legislative agenda through government bills |
| **Policy Direction** | Sets government policy within constitutional framework |

### Judicial Checks on Both

| Check | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|

### Other Checks and Balances

```

:::tip Key Balance
While the PM has significant executive power, they remain accountable to Parliament. Parliament is sovereign but bound by the Constitution. The Judiciary interprets the Constitution and protects it from violations. No single branch is supreme.
:::

## Federal vs. Provincial Structure

### Division of Powers

Pakistan is a **federal state** where power is divided between:
- **Central/Federal Government** (Islamabad)
- **Provincial Governments** (4 provinces: Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan)

#### **Federal Subjects** (Exclusive to Central Government)

- Defense and foreign affairs
- Currency and monetary policy
- Interstate commerce
- Federal taxation
- Nuclear energy
- International treaties
- Federal civil service

#### **Provincial Subjects** (Devolved to Provinces)

- Education and health (after 18th Amendment)
- Local government and administration
- Agriculture and irrigation
- Housing and public works
- Police and local order
- Social welfare
- Many administrative matters

#### **Concurrent Subjects** (Both Levels)**

- Taxation (both can tax)
- Labor laws
- Commercial regulation
- Criminal law (in coordination)
- Marriage and family law

:::note 18th Amendment Impact
The **18th Amendment (2010)** devolved significant powers to provinces, making Pakistan more federal. Education and health, previously federal subjects, now fall under provincial control, allowing better localized governance.
:::

---

## Conclusion

Pakistan's government structure is a carefully designed **federal parliamentary system** that balances power among three branches and between the center and provinces. The system is built on the principle of:

1. **Separation of Powers**: Each branch has distinct responsibilities
2. **Checks and Balances**: Each branch can restrain others from overreach
3. **Constitutional Supremacy**: All organs bound by the Constitution
4. **Federalism**: Power shared between center and provinces
5. **Rule of Law**: All institutions subject to law and Constitution

While the system has faced challenges—including military interventions and political instability—its constitutional framework remains designed to ensure democratic governance, protection of rights, and prevention of authoritarian concentration of power.
