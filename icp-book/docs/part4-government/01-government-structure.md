# Government Structure of Pakistan

## Introduction

The **Islamic Republic of Pakistan** functions as a **federal parliamentary republic** as defined by the **Constitution of 1973**. The state's authority is distributed among three distinct but interconnected branches: the **Legislature** (which makes laws), the **Executive** (which enforces laws), and the **Judiciary** (which interprets laws).

This **separation of powers** is designed to ensure checks and balances, with the Constitution acting as the supreme law of the land. This structural design prevents the concentration of power in a single institution and protects fundamental rights while maintaining governmental stability.

---

## 1. The Legislative Branch (Parliament / Majlis-e-Shoora)

### Overview

The legislative authority is vested in a **bicameral legislature** known as the **Majlis-e-Shoora** (Council of Consultation). The Parliament consists of the President and two Houses: the **National Assembly** and the **Senate**.

### Parliamentary Structure

```
MAJLIS-E-SHOORA (PARLIAMENT)
│
├── The President (Constitutional Head)
│   └── Ceremonial Role in Legislation
│
├── NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (Lower House)
│   ├── 266 General Seats
│   ├── 60 Reserved for Women
│   └── 10 Reserved for Non-Muslims
│       Total: 336 Members
│
└── SENATE (Upper House)
    ├── 23 Members per Province (4 provinces)
    ├── 4 Members from Islamabad
    └── Total: 96 Members
```

### The President (as part of Parliament)

While primarily the Head of State, the President is technically part of the Parliament. Their assent is required for a Bill to become an Act (Law), though their power to reject bills is limited by the Constitution.

**Key Functions:**
- Grants assent to legislation
- Acts as ceremonial figurehead
- May return bills for reconsideration (limited veto power)

### The National Assembly (Lower House)

#### **Representation & Composition**

The National Assembly represents the **population** of Pakistan.

| Aspect | Details |

| **Women Seats** | 60 (reserved; filled via proportional representation) |
| **Minority Seats** | 10 (non-Muslims; filled via proportional representation) |
| **Term** | 5 years (or dissolution by President if government loses majority) |
| **Voting Eligibility** | Pakistani citizens aged 18+ |

#### **Powers & Functions**

- **Money Bills**: Exclusive power to pass budget and financial legislation
- **Election of PM**: Elects the Prime Minister from among its members
- **Legislation**: Debates and passes all ordinary legislation
- **Oversight**: Holds the government accountable through question hours and no-confidence motions
- **Constitutional Amendments**: Can initiate amendments (requires 2/3 majority for some)
- **Impeachment**: Can impeach President or judges

:::note Important
The National Assembly is more powerful than the Senate because it represents the people directly and controls financial matters—the lifeblood of government.
:::

### The Senate (Upper House)

#### **Representation & Composition**

The Senate represents the **provinces equally** to prevent the domination of more populous provinces (like Punjab) over smaller ones.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Total Members** | 96 |
| **Provincial Members** | 23 per province (4 provinces × 23 = 92) |
| **Islamabad Members** | 4 |
| **Breakdown per Province** | 14 General + 4 Women + 4 Technocrats + 1 Minority |
| **Selection Method** | Elected by Provincial Assemblies (not direct voting) |
| **Term** | 6 years (half retire every 3 years) |
| **Dissolution** | Cannot be dissolved (permanent house) |

#### **Powers & Functions**

| Function | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Legislative Review** | Reviews bills passed by National Assembly |

:::info Senate's Strategic Role
The Senate ensures that the federal structure of Pakistan is maintained. By giving equal representation to all provinces regardless of population, it prevents Punjab (with ~60% of population) from dominating legislation at the expense of smaller provinces.
:::

### Comparison: National Assembly vs. Senate

| Feature | National Assembly | Senate |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Type** | Lower House | Upper House |
| **Representation** | Population-based | Province-based (Equal) |

| **Term** | 5 years | 6 years |
| **Dissolution** | Can be dissolved | Permanent house |

## Separation of Powers and Checks & Balances

### Fundamental Principle

The **doctrine of separation of powers** ensures that no single branch becomes too powerful. Each branch is independent but has mechanisms to check the others.

### Legislative Checks on Executive

| Check | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **No-Confidence Motion** | Can remove PM/government by majority vote |
| **Budget Approval** | National Assembly controls budget and taxation |
| **Legislation** | Can pass laws to restrain executive action |
| **Parliamentary Questions** | Cabinet answerable to Parliament |
| **Committees** | Parliamentary committees investigate executive actions |
| **Constitutional Amendment** | Can amend Constitution (with supermajority) |

### Executive Checks on Legislature

| Check | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Veto Power** | President (on PM's advice) returns bills for reconsideration |
| **Ordinance Power** | PM advises President to issue ordinances when Parliament not in session |
| **Dissolution** | PM can advise President to dissolve National Assembly |
| **Agenda Control** | Controls legislative agenda through government bills |
| **Policy Direction** | Sets government policy within constitutional framework |

### Judicial Checks on Both

| Check | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Judicial Review** | Can strike down laws as unconstitutional |
| **Constitutional Interpretation** | Interprets Constitution and laws |
| **Fundamental Rights** | Protects rights through writ jurisdiction |
| **Restraining Orders** | Can issue orders to stop unconstitutional action |
| **Guardianship** | Protects democratic and constitutional order |

### Other Checks and Balances

```

:::tip Key Balance
While the PM has significant executive power, they remain accountable to Parliament. Parliament is sovereign but bound by the Constitution. The Judiciary interprets the Constitution and protects it from violations. No single branch is supreme.
:::

## Federal vs. Provincial Structure

### Division of Powers

Pakistan is a **federal state** where power is divided between:
- **Central/Federal Government** (Islamabad)
- **Provincial Governments** (4 provinces: Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan)

#### **Federal Subjects** (Exclusive to Central Government)

- Defense and foreign affairs
- Currency and monetary policy
- Interstate commerce
- Federal taxation
- Nuclear energy
- International treaties
- Federal civil service

#### **Provincial Subjects** (Devolved to Provinces)

- Education and health (after 18th Amendment)
- Local government and administration
- Agriculture and irrigation
- Housing and public works
- Police and local order
- Social welfare
- Many administrative matters

#### **Concurrent Subjects** (Both Levels)**

- Taxation (both can tax)
- Labor laws
- Commercial regulation
- Criminal law (in coordination)
- Marriage and family law

:::note 18th Amendment Impact
The **18th Amendment (2010)** devolved significant powers to provinces, making Pakistan more federal. Education and health, previously federal subjects, now fall under provincial control, allowing better localized governance.
:::

---

## Conclusion

Pakistan's government structure is a carefully designed **federal parliamentary system** that balances power among three branches and between the center and provinces. The system is built on the principle of:

1. **Separation of Powers**: Each branch has distinct responsibilities
2. **Checks and Balances**: Each branch can restrain others from overreach
3. **Constitutional Supremacy**: All organs bound by the Constitution
4. **Federalism**: Power shared between center and provinces
5. **Rule of Law**: All institutions subject to law and Constitution

While the system has faced challenges—including military interventions and political instability—its constitutional framework remains designed to ensure democratic governance, protection of rights, and prevention of authoritarian concentration of power.
