# Communism, Religion, and Governance in Pakistan

## Introduction

The political history and government structure of Pakistan have been deeply shaped by two major forces: the fight between **Communism and Islamic Nationalism**, and internal **religious differences** showing up as sectarianism and religious politics. These two forces have influenced Pakistan's local policies, foreign relations, military actions, and the very nature of government in the country.

Unlike most states where challenges come from outside, Pakistan has faced these challenges **from within**, creating deep tensions between:
- **Secular/Socialist ideas** vs. **Islamic ideas**
- **Class-based movements** vs. **Religious movements**
- **International communism** vs. **National Islamic identity**
- **Sunni majority** vs. **Shia and other minorities**

Understanding these forces is needed to understand Pakistan's government challenges and political instability.

## Part I: The Role of Communism in Pakistan

### Historical Context: Pakistan and the Cold War

Pakistan emerged in 1947 at the dawn of the **Cold War** with a strategic choice:
- Aligned with the **Western Bloc** (United States)
- Positioned against the **Soviet Bloc**
- Adopted **Capitalism** over **Communism**

This choice was influenced by:
1. **Geopolitical**: Soviet proximity through Central Asia; US far away
2. **Ideological**: Founder Quaid-e-Azam envisioned Islamic state, not communist
3. **Religious**: Islam's opposition to atheistic materialism
4. **Economic**: Western aid and investment needed post-partition

### Early Suppression: The Rawalpindi Conspiracy (1951)

#### **The Conspiracy**

The first major incident showing state fear of communism was the **Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case of 1951**.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Leaders** | Major General Akbar Khan, Faiz Ahmed Faiz (poet), Sajjad Zaheer |
| **Goal** | Overthrow PM Liaquat Ali Khan |
| **Motivation** | Opposition to pro-Western foreign policy and Kashmir war handling |
| **Ideology** | Blend of military dissent and leftist ideology |
| **Outcome** | Conspirators arrested; severe crackdown on left |

#### **Why It Mattered**

The Rawalpindi Conspiracy set an important example:
- Communism labeled as **"anti-state"** and **"anti-Islamic"**
- State began **organized suppression** of leftist movements
- Military gained role as **protector against communist entry**
- Gave reasons for harsh measures against the left
- Fixed the story: **Communist = Enemy of Pakistan**

:::warning State Narrative Solidified
The conspiracy allowed military and religious leadership to frame communism as:
- A foreign ideology (Soviet)
- Against Islam
- Threatening national security
- A legitimate target for suppression

This narrative persisted throughout Pakistan's history.
:::

### 1954 Ban: Communist Party of Pakistan Outlawed

#### **The Ban**

In **1954**, following the Rawalpindi Conspiracy aftermath, the **Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP)** was officially banned by the government.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Official Justification** | Alleged plots against government and state security |
| **Real Reason** | Fear of communist infiltration; Cold War ideology |
| **Method** | Constitutional suppression under preventive detention laws |
| **Duration** | Long-term ban; underground activities persisted |

#### **Underground Activities**

While the CPP was banned, communism did not disappear:

```
COMMUNIST MOVEMENT - FROM LEGAL TO UNDERGROUND

1947-1951: LEGAL EXISTENCE
├── CPP functions openly
├── Labor unions formed
└── Student organizations active

1951-1954: PARTIAL SUPPRESSION
├── Key leaders arrested
├── Party weakened
└── Activities continue quietly

1954 onwards: UNDERGROUND MOVEMENT
├── CPP operates clandestinely
├── Democratic Students Federation (DSF) becomes vehicle
├── Labor unions continue
└── Infiltration into mainstream parties
```

#### **Democratic Students Federation (DSF)**

The **DSF** became the primary vehicle for communist influence after 1954:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Nature** | Student organization supposedly for secular/socialist education |
| **Reality** | Thinly veiled communist front |
| **Influence** | Strong in Punjab universities, esp. Lahore |
| **Activities** | Organize strikes, protests, class consciousness campaigns |
| **Banned** | Eventually banned multiple times by different governments |

### The 1960s and 1970s: Underground Pressure

Despite the ban, leftist movements pressured the state on several issues:

**Issues Pushed by Leftist Movements:**
- **Land Reforms**: Breaking up landlord power structures
- **Labor Rights**: Minimum wages, better working conditions
- **Worker Organization**: Union rights and collective bargaining
- **Class Consciousness**: Highlighting wealth inequality
- **Anti-Feudalism**: Criticizing feudal power in politics

:::note Pressure from Underground
Though the organized Communist Party was banned, leftist pressure contributed to:
- Land reform initiatives
- Labor legislation
- Socialist-leaning policies in some periods
- Challenge to feudal power structures

This shows that even suppressed ideologies can influence policy through grassroots pressure.
:::

### The 1970s: "Islamic Socialism" - An Attempt to Bridge Ideologies

#### **Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Hybrid Approach**

When **Zulfikar Ali Bhutto** came to power in 1971, he attempted something unique: merging socialism with Islam.

#### **"Islamic Socialism" Framework**

| Economic Policy | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Nationalization** | Took over industries (steel, sugar, banks) |
| **Land Reform** | Redistributed land; abolished landlord privileges |
| **Labor Rights** | Implemented labor protection laws |
| **Welfare State** | Provided public education, health services |
| **Ideological Frame** | Claimed all reforms were based on Islamic justice |

#### **Quranic Justification**

Bhutto argued that Islamic socialism was rooted in:

| Principle | Quranic Basis |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Equality** | "All humans are equal as the teeth of a comb" (Hadith) |
| **Social Justice** | Prohibition of interest, emphasis on Zakat |
| **Communal Property** | Islamic concept of collective welfare |
| **Worker Rights** | Islamic emphasis on fair wages and labor dignity |

:::info Bridging Ideology
Bhutto's "Islamic Socialism" was an attempt to:
- Accept socialist economic principles (popular among youth)
- Frame them as Islamic (acceptable to traditional society)
- Modernize while remaining within Islamic framework
- Appeal to both leftists and religious constituencies

This was a creative but ultimately fragile compromise.
:::

#### **Opposition from Ulema (Religious Scholars)**

Despite Bhutto's framing, religious scholars fiercely opposed:

| Objection | Religious Scholar Argument |
|-----------|----------------|
| **"Socialism Denies God"** | Marxism clearly denies God; cannot work with Islam |
| **"Communism is Kufr" (Disbelief)** | Issued religious rulings saying socialism is un-Islamic |
| **"Anti-Religious"** | Class struggle idea ignores spiritual side |
| **"Western Import"** | Socialism is foreign idea; Islam has its own system |

**Result**: Religious parties and scholars launched massive campaign against Bhutto's policies, ultimately contributing to his removal from power.

### The Zia Era (1977-1988): Defeating Communism Through Islamization

#### **General Zia-ul-Haq's Strategy**

When **General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq** took power in a military coup (1977), he adopted a two-pronged strategy:

**Against Communism:**
- Declared Islam as antidote to communism
- Launched **Islamization campaign**
- Promoted religious education
- Supported Mujahideen in Afghanistan against Soviets

**Against Bhutto's Socialism:**
- Reversed nationalization policies
- Returned industries to private sector
- Reduced welfare state commitments
- Empowered traditional religious and feudal elites

#### **The Afghanistan Connection: Proxy War**

Zia's most significant anti-communist action was support for Afghan Mujahideen:

```
THE AFGHANISTAN CONFLICT (1979-1989)

Combatants:
├── SOVIET UNION & COMMUNIST AFGHANISTAN
│   └── Trying to spread communism
│
└── MUJAHIDEEN (Fighters for Islam)
    ├── Pakistani: Hosted in refugee camps
    ├── American: Funded by US CIA
    ├── Saudi: Funded by Saudi Arabia
    └── Afghan: Fighting Soviet occupation

Pakistan's Role:
├── Provided training camps
├── Supported Sunni Mujahideen groups
├── Hosted 2-3 million Afghan refugees
├── Acted as conduit for US weapons
└── STRATEGIC VICTORY: Soviets withdrew in 1989
```

:::success Anti-Communist Victory
The Afghanistan war was framed as Islamic struggle against atheistic communism. Pakistan and US defeated Soviet communism without direct US-Soviet military confrontation (proxy war). This was seen as a triumph of Islam over communism.
:::

#### **Unintended Consequences**

However, the Afghanistan war had terrible unexpected results:

**Rise of Militant Groups:**
- Made Sunni extreme groups powerful
- Created well-armed, trained militant networks
- Brought weapons culture into Pakistani society
- Made youth extreme through jihad ideas

**Sectarian Violence:**
- Sunni-led Mujahideen got weapons from state
- Shia groups formed counter-groups (feeling left out and threatened)
- State's support of Sunni militants increased sectarian violence
- Created dangerous example of state-backed militant groups

---

## Part II: The Role of Religious Differences in Governance

### Overview

While communism was consistently suppressed, **religious differences** played a different role:
- Religious mobilization sometimes supported by state
- Weaponized by political leaders for legitimacy
- Caused dramatic policy changes and constitutional amendments
- Led to extreme communal violence

### The 1953 Anti-Ahmadi Riots: First Crisis

#### **The Incident**

The **first major religious crisis** in Pakistan occurred in **1953** with anti-Ahmadi riots in Lahore.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Demand** | Declare Ahmadis (Followers of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad) as non-Muslims |
| **Led By** | Religious parties: Majlis-e-Ahrar, Jamaat-e-Islami |
| **Method** | Violent riots and street agitation |
| **Result** | Imposition of martial law in Lahore |
| **Consequence** | First major military intervention in politics |

#### **Why This Mattered for Governance**

The 1953 riots revealed:

```
GOVERNANCE IMPLICATIONS OF 1953 RIOTS

Religion as Political Tool:
├── Religious parties used anti-Ahmadi sentiment
├── Mobilized masses through religious emotion
├── Proved religious issues could paralyze government
└── Showed military's willingness to intervene

Setting Dangerous Precedent:
├── Religious violence → Military takeover (positive)
├── Encouraged future religious agitation
├── Suggested religious demands could succeed through violence
└── Empowered religious leadership politically

Impact on Constitutional Order:
├── Demonstrated limits of civilian government
├── Invited military as guarantor of order
└── Showed religious questions could be constitutional matters
```

:::warning Precedent for Future Crises
The success of religious parties in forcing the Ahmadi issue in 1953 set a template:
1. Mobilize masses on religious ground
2. Create civil disorder
3. Government unable to control
4. Military steps in
5. Religious demand often partially conceded

This pattern repeated multiple times in Pakistan's history.
:::

### The 1974 Second Amendment: Ahmadis Declared Non-Muslim

#### **Constitutional Change Through Religious Pressure**

Despite **21 years passing**, religious pressure continued. In **1974**, under Bhutto, the **Second Amendment** was passed.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Date** | September 8, 1974 |
| **Amendment** | Added to Article 260 (Definition of Muslim) |
| **Content** | Officially declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims |
| **Method** | Constitutional amendment through National Assembly |
| **Significance** | First time Constitution explicitly excluded a group from Muslim identity |

#### **What the Amendment Said**

The amendment inserted this definition:

> "A person who does not believe in the absolute and unqualified finality of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) but believes in and acknowledges, as a religious personage, any person who appeared or appears after Muhammad for any purpose whatsoever, is not a Muslim."

:::warning Constitutional Precedent
This amendment had major implications:
- State endorsing religious interpretation of Muslim identity
- Constitutional redefinition based on religious orthodoxy
- Set precedent for using Constitution for religious objectives
- Undermined secular aspects of Constitution
- Demonstrated power of religious mobilization to change fundamental law

This represented **"constitutionalization of religious orthodoxy"**.
:::

#### **Impact on Ahmadis**

The amendment led to:
- **Legal Discrimination**: Ahmadis stopped from calling themselves Muslims
- **Job Restrictions**: Stopped from certain government jobs
- **Religious Restrictions**: Cannot spread faith or use Islamic words
- **Social Stigma**: Increased community discrimination
- **International Concern**: Raised human rights questions

### The Zia Era (1977-1988): Religion in Governance

#### **Islamization as Governance Strategy**

Zia used **religion as a fundamental governance tool**:

| Policy | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Shariat Courts** | Created Federal Shariat Court to test laws against Islam |
| **Islamic Curriculum** | Mandated Islamic education in schools |
| **Hudood Laws** | Introduced Islamic criminal laws (controversial) |
| **Islamic Banking** | Implemented interest-free banking system |
| **Friday Holidays** | Made Friday official holiday for congregational prayer |
| **Dress Code** | Encouraged modest Islamic dress in public institutions |

:::info Religious Governance Approach
Zia's strategy was to legitimize military rule through:
- Associating military with Islamic values
- Positioning military as defender of Islam
- Framing development as Islamization
- Using religion to suppress opposition

This created a model where military dictatorship claimed Islamic legitimacy.
:::

### Sectarian Violence: The Zia-Era Crisis (1980s-2000s)

#### **The Sunni-Shia Conflict**

The most serious consequence of religious politicization was the rise of **sectarian violence** between Sunni and Shia communities.

#### **How Sectarianism Emerged**

```
RISE OF SECTARIAN VIOLENCE

1979: IRANIAN REVOLUTION
└── Shia majority gains power; raises Shia consciousness

1980: AFGHANISTAN WAR BEGINS
├── US funds Sunni Mujahideen through Pakistan/Saudi Arabia
├── Saudi Arabia promotes Wahhabi interpretation (strictly Sunni)
└── Shias feel marginalized; form counter-organizations

1982-1990: PEAK SECTARIAN VIOLENCE
├── Sipah-e-Sahaba (Sunni militant group) founded
├── Tehrik-e-Jafria (Shia militant group) founded
├── Sectarian killings reach hundreds per year
├── Suicide bombings of mosques (both Sunni and Shia)
└── Entire neighborhoods become communally segregated

2000s: Continued Violence
├── Balochistan and Karachi worst affected
├── Religious parties exploit sectarian tensions
├── Military government unable to control
└── Civil society deeply affected
```

#### **Key Militant Groups**

| Organization | Ideology | Activities |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP)** | Sunni militant | Killings of Shias; sectarian violence |
| **Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LJ)** | Sunni extremist | Suicide bombings; terrorist attacks |
| **Tehrik-e-Jafria Pakistan (TJP)** | Shia reaction | Counter-attacks; militant response |
| **Imamia Students Organization (ISO)** | Shia youth | Political mobilization |

#### **Impact on Governance**

Sectarian violence had profound impacts on Pakistan's governance:

| Impact | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Civil Harmony** | Destroyed communal peace; segregated neighborhoods |
| **Law and Order** | Police unable to control sectarian killings |
| **Institutions** | Religious parties gained political leverage |
| **Education** | Segregated schools by sect; communal textbooks |
| **Security Services** | Sectarian tensions infiltrated military/police |
| **Federal Structure** | Some provinces (Balochistan, Karachi) destabilized |
| **International** | Pakistan's image damaged; human rights concerns |

:::warning State Complicity Debate
There is significant debate about state role in sectarianism:

**Accusation**: Military/intelligence agencies backed Sunni groups to:
- Counter Iranian influence
- Maintain control through divide-and-rule
- Suppress political opposition using sectarian violence
- Redirect anti-government sentiment into sectarian channels

**Defense**: State claims it:
- Tried to control sectarian violence
- Banned militant organizations
- Didn't deliberately fuel tensions
- Was itself victim of sectarian violence

The truth likely involves elements of both.
:::

### Ahmadi Persecution: Continued Marginalization

#### **Beyond the 1974 Amendment**

The Second Amendment was only the beginning:

| Year | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1977-1988** | Zia Era | Added Ordinance XX (1984) banning Ahmadi preaching |
| **1984** | Ordinance XX | Ahmadis forbidden from "preaching" Islam; made criminal offense |
| **1990s** | Discrimination** | Employment restrictions; educational barriers |
| **2000s-2010s** | Persecution** | Mob violence against Ahmadi centers; killings |
| **2010 onwards** | Ongoing** | Periodic violence; discrimination in society |

#### **Ordinance XX (1984)**

The most severe anti-Ahmadi measure, enacted under Zia:

| Rule | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **No Spreading Faith** | Ahmadis cannot spread their faith; it is a crime |
| **No Islamic Words** | Cannot call themselves Muslims; cannot use Islamic words |
| **Criminal Punishment** | Up to 3 years in prison for breaking this law |
| **Wide Understanding** | Courts understand it broadly; even private prayer can be made a crime |

:::danger Religious Freedom Violation
Ordinance XX is criticized internationally as:
- Violation of freedom of religion (Article 18)
- Violation of freedom of expression (Article 19)
- Discrimination based on religion
- Against Pakistan's own constitutional safeguards
- Incompatible with human rights standards

Despite legal challenges, ordinance remains in effect.
:::

## Part III: Ideological Tension and Constitutional Identity

### Pakistan as an Ideological State

Pakistan's founding was unique: unlike most nations founded on territory or ethnicity, Pakistan was founded on **ideology** — the concept of a nation for Muslims of the subcontinent.

#### **This Created Tensions**

| Tension | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Secular vs. Religious** | How Islamic should state be? |
| **Ideological vs. Pragmatic** | Can pragmatism compromise ideology? |
| **Inclusive vs. Exclusive** | Who belongs to Pakistan? |
| **Nationalist vs. Universal** | National Islam or Universal Islam? |

### The Secular Impulse

Despite Islamic foundation, Pakistan had secular impulses:

**Secular Elements in Constitution:**
- Universal suffrage (not Islamic)
- Parliamentary democracy (not explicitly Islamic)
- Constitutional court system (not Shariat courts alone)
- Protection of non-Muslim minorities
- Separation of powers (checks on religious authority)

:::info Secular Space in Islamic State
Despite being an "Islamic Republic," Pakistan's constitution has:
- Secular structure (separation of powers)
- Secular protections (fundamental rights)
- Secular procedures (parliamentary process)
- Secular space for non-Muslims

This reflects Quaid-e-Azam's vision of Islamic state with secular governance structures.
:::

### The Religious Impulse

Countering secular elements are strong religious pressures:

**Religious Mobilization Forces:**
- Religious parties demanding Islamization
- Ulema (scholars) asserting religious authority
- Popular religiosity demanding Islamic governance
- International Islamic movements (Saudi, Iranian)
- Cold War use of Islam against communism

### Constitutional Oscillation

Pakistan's governance has **oscillated** between secular and religious poles:

```
PAKISTAN'S IDEOLOGICAL PENDULUM

        SECULAR
        (Bhutto,
         Benazir)
            |
            |
            v
    MORE ISLAMIC
    (Zia, Musharraf)
            ^
            |
            |
     LESS ISLAMIC
     (Military
      pragmatism)
```

---

## Part IV: Comparative Impact - Communism vs. Religion

### Two Opposing Forces

The suppression of communism and elevation of religion created an asymmetry:

| Factor | Communism | Religion |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **State Approach** | Suppression | Promotion (often) |
| **Mobilization** | Limited (suppressed) | Widespread (encouraged) |
| **Institutional Power** | Excluded from power | Inserted into governance |
| **Violence Associated** | Limited (suppressed) | Sectarian violence flourished |
| **Constitutional Impact** | Little formal change | Major constitutional amendments |
| **International Alignment** | Against US interest | With US/Saudi/Western interest |

:::note Ironic Result
By suppressing communism and promoting religion, Pakistan's governance:
- Weakened secular/socialist countervailing forces
- Empowered religious extremism
- Created sectarian divisions
- Allowed religious parties to dominate
- Weakened democratic institutions (religious parties often anti-democratic)

The irony: avoiding communist "threat" may have harmed democratic development.
:::

### Long-term Consequences

```
COMPARATIVE CONSEQUENCES

SUPPRESSION OF COMMUNISM:
├── Prevented communist takeover
├── But eliminated left-wing checks on feudalism
├── Reduced pressure for economic justice
├── Weakened worker and peasant movements
└── Allowed feudal landlords to maintain power

ELEVATION OF RELIGION IN GOVERNANCE:
├── Strengthened state against atheistic ideologies
├── But introduced sectarian tensions
├── Empowered religious extremism
├── Undermined secular democracy
├── Created religious militancy
└── Harmed minorities (especially Ahmadis)

NET RESULT: Pakistan stronger against communism,
but weaker in democratic governance and social harmony
```

---

## Part V: Governance Implications and Lessons

### How Ideology Shapes Governance

Pakistan's experience shows how ideological choices profoundly shape governance:

#### **1. Security Threats Shape Institutional Development**

| Period | Threat | Response | Consequence |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| **1947-1954** | Communist infiltration | Military intervention normalized | Military became political force |
| **1979-1989** | Soviet communism | Islamic mobilization | Religion entered governance |
| **1980s-2000s** | Sectarian violence | Military crackdowns | Centralized authority |

#### **2. Religious Politicization Weakens Democracy**

- Religious mobilization on non-constitutional issues (Ahmadi identity)
- Street violence can overturn constitutional order
- Encourages military intervention (as protector of Islam)
- Weakens rule of law (religious demands override law)

#### **3. Suppression Without Alternative Weakens Development**

- Suppressing communism without socialist alternative
- Weakened pressure for land reform, labor rights, economic justice
- Feudal and capitalist elites maintained power
- Inequality persisted and increased

### Lessons for Democratic Governance

**What Pakistan's Experience Teaches:**

1. **Ideological Foundation Matters**: How a state defines itself (Islamic vs. Secular) profoundly shapes its governance

2. **Security Concerns Can Override Rights**: Fear of communism justified suppression of civil liberties

3. **Religious Politicization Destabilizes**: Using religion for political legitimacy can trigger sectarian violence

4. **Balance is Crucial**: Completely suppressing one ideology without balancing forces is dangerous

5. **Institutional Independence is Vital**: When military or religious groups dominate, rule of law suffers

---

## Conclusion

The interaction of **Communism and Religion** in Pakistan's governance reveals crucial truths:

1. **Ideologies Matter**: How states define their ideological identity shapes policies, institutions, and stability

2. **Double-Edged Sword**: While suppressing communism prevented one threat, promoting religion without limits created new threats

3. **Sectarianism as Governance Tool**: Using religion to legitimize governance leads to sectarian violence

4. **Trade-offs Exist**: Pakistan chose to:
   - Eliminate communist threat BUT weaken secular countervailing forces
   - Strengthen Islamic identity BUT empower religious extremism
   - Support Sunni movements BUT create sectarian violence

5. **Democratic Health Requires Balance**:
   - Check on religious extremism (secular/rational voice)
   - Check on authoritarian government (civil society)
   - Inclusive governance (not excluding groups)
   - Rule of law (above ideological concerns)

As Pakistan continues to develop, these lessons remain relevant. The challenge is:
- **Strengthen democratic institutions** (not military or religious authority)
- **Protect minority rights** (esp. Ahmadis and sectarian minorities)
- **Decentralize power** (allow regional/local autonomy)
- **Emphasize rule of law** (over ideological governance)
- **Create space for diverse ideologies** (communism, socialism, capitalism, religious conservatism)
