# Rights and Responsibilities of Pakistani Citizens

## Introduction

The **1973 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan** creates a complete system that gives citizens important rights while also setting basic duties. The Constitution is not just a paper that protects personal freedom; it also explains the **relationship between the person and the state** through a clear "social contract."

This balance between rights and responsibilities is needed for national stability, democratic rule, and social unity. **Article 5** is very important as it sets the basic duties of every citizen, while **Articles 8-28** list the basic rights. Understanding both sides is key to knowing how the Pakistani state works and what it asks of its citizens.

## Part II: Fundamental Duties and Responsibilities (Article 5)

### Overview and Importance

**Article 5** is unique among constitutional documents worldwide. While most constitutions focus on protecting rights, Article 5 explicitly establishes the **fundamental duties** of citizens. It serves as the "social contract" between the individual and the state.

### Article 5(1): Loyalty to the State

#### **The Duty**

*"Loyalty to the State is the basic duty of every citizen."*

#### **Nature of the Duty**

| Aspect | Explanation |
|--------|------------|
| **"Basic Duty"** | Foundational obligation; more fundamental than other duties |
| **Universal** | Applies to all citizens, regardless of class, caste, or creed |
| **Inherent** | Exists by virtue of being a Pakistani citizen |
| **Perpetual** | Applies "wherever" the person may be |

#### **Practical Implications of Loyalty**

Loyalty to the state requires citizens to:

**Positive Obligations:**
- Support the sovereignty and integrity of Pakistan
- Defend the state when national security is threatened
- Respect the constitutional order
- Contribute to national development
- Participate in national defense (if called upon)
- Pay taxes and fulfill civic duties

**Negative Obligations (What to Avoid):**
- Avoid anti-state activities and sedition
- Refrain from espionage or sharing state secrets
- Not support separatist movements
- Not collaborate with enemies of the state
- Not engage in treason or high treason
- Not undermine constitutional order

:::warning Sedition vs. Criticism
Important distinction:
- **Legitimate**: Criticizing government policies, demanding reforms, peaceful protest
- **Sedition**: Speech inciting violence, advocating overthrow of state, supporting enemies

The state cannot punish legitimate criticism as sedition.
:::

#### **Applications in Practice**

| Scenario | Duty of Loyalty Requires |
|----------|------------------------|
| **National Emergency** | Citizens must support state defense |
| **Military Service** | Serve nation when conscripted |
| **Tax Payment** | Contribute to state revenue |
| **Law Obedience** | Follow constitutional and legal order |
| **Peaceful Conduct** | Not engage in anti-state activity |

:::info Loyalty in Islamic Tradition
Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh) emphasizes loyalty to the Islamic state and obedience to its laws as a religious duty. Article 5 incorporates this principle into Pakistani constitutional law.
:::

### Article 5(2): Obedience to the Constitution and Law

#### **The Duty**

*"Obedience to the Constitution and law is the inviolable obligation of every citizen wherever he may be and of every other person for the time being within Pakistan."*

#### **Key Terminology Explained**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **"Cannot be broken"** | Cannot be stopped or ignored under any situation |
| **Obligation** | Required duty; not a choice |
| **"Wherever he may be"** | Pakistani citizens must follow law even when in other countries |
| **"Every other person"** | Foreigners and visitors in Pakistan must also follow Pakistani law |

#### **Who is Bound by This Obligation?**

```
OBEDIENCE TO LAW - UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Pakistani Citizens                         │

- Government power limited by constitution and law
:::

| **Subversion of Constitution** | Attempting to abrogate/subvert constitution |

## Part III: Comparative Framework - Rights vs. Responsibilities

### The Balance: Rights and Duties

```
CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS ←→ CITIZENSHIP DUTIES

```

The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to issue special orders:

| Order Type | Purpose | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Habeas Corpus** | Protect right to freedom | Illegal arrest or detention |
| **Mandamus** | Force official to do their job | Official refusing to do legal duty |
| **Prohibition** | Stop illegal action | Court acting without proper power |
| **Certiorari** | Review decisions | Challenging court decisions |
| **Quo Warranto** | Question authority | Ask if official has right to their position |

#### **Public Interest Litigation (PIL)**

Any citizen can go to courts to protect:
- Basic rights of large groups
- Public interest in environment or social matters
- Rights of weak or poor people who cannot go to courts
- Constitutional protections

:::info Access to Justice
Through PIL, the courts have made justice accessible to common people. A citizen or NGO can petition the Supreme Court directly without going through lower courts if fundamental rights are violated.
:::

### Limitation on Rights

While rights are fundamental, they can be limited in certain circumstances:

#### **Article 1-A: Suspension During Emergency**

During state of emergency:

  - Right to life (Article 8)
  - Right to dignity (Article 14)
  - Protection from torture (Article 14)

2. **Necessary**: Restriction must be necessary (not merely convenient)
3. **Proportionate**: Benefits must outweigh harm to rights

## Part VI: Special Provisions for Minorities

### Constitutional Protections for Non-Muslim Citizens

Pakistan's constitution contains specific provisions protecting minorities:

| Provision | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| **Article 20** | Freedom of religion and conscience |
| **Article 21** | Protection of religious beliefs and practices |
| **Article 22** | Rights of minorities in education and personal law |
| **Article 26** | Special constitutional provision against religious discrimination |
| **Minority Seats** | Reserved seats in Parliament and Provincial Assemblies |

### Ahmadi Community - Special Context

The **Second Amendment (1974)** declared Ahmadis (followers of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad) as non-Muslims. This decision:
- Remains controversial
- Has led to legal and social discrimination
- Created special legal status different from other minorities
- Raises questions about religious liberty and inclusion

:::warning Complex Issue
The Ahmadi question represents tension between:
- Islamic orthodoxy (mainstream Muslim belief)
- Religious liberty and minority protection
- Constitutional secularism
- Pakistan's ideological identity

This remains a challenging issue in Pakistani constitutional law and society.
:::

---

## Conclusion

The relationship between rights and responsibilities forms the foundation of citizenship in Pakistan. The Constitution grants citizens significant freedoms and protections, but these are balanced by fundamental duties of loyalty to the state and obedience to law.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Rights are Protected**: Citizens enjoy extensive fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 8-28
2. **Duties are Mandatory**: Citizens have binding duties under Article 5
3. **Balance is Essential**: Rights and duties must be balanced for social stability
4. **Courts are Guardians**: Judiciary protects rights through writ jurisdiction
5. **Rule of Law Prevails**: No person, however powerful, is above the law
6. **Civic Culture Matters**: Beyond constitutional duties, good citizenship requires civic participation

As Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah stated:

> "Democracy is in the blood of the Muslims. Qur'an is the greatest democracy that the world has ever known."

This reflects the vision that Pakistan's constitutional order, while modern and secular in structure, is rooted in Islamic principles of justice, equality, and consultation (Shura).
