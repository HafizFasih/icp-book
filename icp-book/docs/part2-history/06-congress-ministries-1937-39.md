## Overview

The Congress Ministries were formed following the **Provincial Elections of 1937**, held under the Government of India Act 1935. The Indian National Congress secured a massive victory, winning absolute majorities in five provinces and forming governments in a total of eight provinces (including Bombay, Bengal, and NWFP via coalitions). In contrast, the Muslim League performed poorly. The rule of the Congress from **July 1937 to October 1939** proved to be a turning point in Indian politics. It was characterized by policies that deeply alienated the Muslim population, convincing them that their rights would not be safe in a Hindu-dominated India, thereby accelerating the demand for a separate homeland.

:::warning
The Congress Ministries period is often called **"the test case"** - it tested whether Muslims could live safely under Hindu majority rule. The result was conclusive: they could not.
:::

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Religious and Cultural Tyranny

The most immediate source of friction was the Congress party's disregard for Muslim religious sentiments.

**The Bande Mataram Issue:**
- The Congress government made the singing of **Bande Mataram** **compulsory** in provincial legislatures and schools
- Bande Mataram was taken from the novel *Anandamath*
- The song contained **anti-Muslim sentiments** and nationalist Hindu themes
- It encouraged the worship of the "Motherland" as a deity (Hindu goddess Durga)
- This was idolatrous and fundamentally unacceptable to Muslims
- Forcing Muslims to sing it was seen as religious coercion
- Students who refused to sing faced punishment and expulsion

**Religious Restrictions on Muslim Practices:**
- Slaughter of cows was **banned** in many areas, despite being necessary for Muslim dietary practices
- The cow, sacred in Hinduism, was given political-religious protection
- **Severe restrictions** were placed on the construction of new mosques
- Permits for mosque construction were routinely denied
- Expansion of existing mosques was prevented

**Harassment During Prayer:**
- Loud music was often played outside mosques **during prayer times** to disturb worshippers
- Police failed to intervene to protect Muslim religious practice
- Hindu mobs sometimes gathered to harass Muslims at prayer times
- Congress police frequently **sided with Hindu mobs** during communal riots
- No protection was provided to Muslim religious activities

:::warning
This was systematic religious persecution using state power - a fundamental violation of religious freedom and minority rights.
:::

### 2. Educational Policies and Language Imposition

The educational reforms introduced by the Congress were widely seen as attempts to erase Muslim identity and indoctrinate Muslim children with Hindu culture.

**The Wardha Scheme:**
- Educational scheme championed by **Mahatma Gandhi**
- Emphasized **manual labor** (particularly spinning cotton as a nationalist activity)
- Required students to **bow before Gandhi's portrait** as part of the curriculum
- Removed **religious education** from the curriculum entirely
- This particularly harmed Muslim students who had no religious instruction
- Muslims feared this would lead to spiritual conversion of their youth
- The scheme was seen as imposing Hindu nationalist values through education

**Vidya Mandir Scheme:**
- Introduced in the **Central Provinces (CP)**
- Renamed schools as "**Vidya Mandirs**" (Temples of Learning)
- This renaming had clear Hindu religious connotations
- Further reinforced Hindu cultural dominance over education
- Made Muslim students feel like outsiders in their own schools
- Explicitly linked education with Hindu cultural and religious identity

**Language Controversy:**
- Congress **aggressively promoted Hindi** written in the Devanagari script
- Made Hindi the official language of education and administration
- **Sidelined Urdu**, the cultural lingua franca of Muslims
- This threatened the literary and cultural heritage of the Muslim community
- By removing Urdu, Muslims were being cut off from their classical literature and heritage
- Hindi-only policy meant Muslims had to abandon their language to succeed
- This was seen as cultural extinction by the Muslim community

:::note
Educational discrimination was particularly insidious because it targeted the young generation, threatening long-term cultural and religious continuity of the Muslim community.
:::

### 3. Political and Economic Discrimination

Politically, the Congress acted with arrogance and exclusionary tactics.

**Refusal of Coalition Governments:**
- Congress refused to form coalition governments with the Muslim League
- Congress demanded a condition: the Muslim League must dissolve its parliamentary board
- Muslim League members would have to dissolve their separate political organization
- Only then could they join the Congress
- This "absorptive" policy meant the **political elimination of the Muslim League**
- It rejected the Two-Nation Theory and separate Muslim political existence
- The offer was essentially: abandon your separate identity and join us

**Economic Discrimination:**
- Muslims were **systematically discriminated against** in government jobs
- Muslim officials were dismissed or bypassed for promotions in favor of Congress supporters
- Government contracts went predominantly to Congress-supporting Hindu businessmen
- Muslims were excluded from economic opportunities that government could provide
- This created economic hardship in Muslim-dominated areas

**Administrative Bias and "Hindu Raj":**
- The administration itself showed clear Hindu bias
- Congress supporters received favorable treatment in all dealings
- The bureaucratic system became an instrument of Congress political interests
- This administrative bias confirmed fears of "**Hindu Raj**" (Hindu rule)
- Muslim leaders like **Muhammad Ali Jinnah** saw this as evidence of inherent Hindu dominance

:::tip
The economic and political discrimination proved that even when Muslims had some democratic representation, the majority could use state power to exclude them systematically.
:::

### 4. The Impact on Muslim Political Consciousness

**Demonstration of Hindu Majority Rule:**
- The 27-month period provided a practical demonstration of how Hindu majority rule would function
- It was not theoretical anymore - Muslims experienced it directly
- Every minority right could be overturned by majority vote
- The majority had monopoly on state power and resources

**Unification of Muslim Community:**
- These oppressive policies united Muslims across sectarian and regional divides
- Even those who had previously pursued cooperation with Congress now opposed it
- The Muslim League, which performed poorly in 1937 elections, gained massive support
- The popularity of Muhammad Ali Jinnah surged

**The "Day of Deliverance" (December 22, 1939):**
- When Congress resigned from power in October 1939 (due to India's involvement in WWII)
- Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah declared **December 22, 1939** as the **"Day of Deliverance"**
- This was a public holiday celebrating the end of Congress rule
- Massive celebrations and processions across India
- This single act showed Muslim emotions were now anti-Congress, not pro-independence unity

:::warning
The "Day of Deliverance" was not about rejoicing over India's freedom struggle - it was about rejoicing that Muslim oppression had ended. This showed complete alienation from the Congress-led independence movement.
:::

## Conclusion

The Congress Ministries came to an abrupt end in **1939** when Congress resigned in protest against the Viceroy's decision to involve India in World War II without consultation.

**Impact on Muslim Politics:**

1. **Proved Two-Nation Theory:** Demonstrated that unified India meant Hindu dominance over Muslims
2. **United Muslim Community:** Previous divisions disappeared; Muslims united under the banner of the Muslim League
3. **Unified Leadership:** Muhammad Ali Jinnah emerged as undisputed leader
4. **Explicit Political Demand:** Shifted from participation to separation - demand for Pakistan became explicit
5. **Timeline Acceleration:** Events that might have taken decades happened in years after 1937

**The Path to Pakistan:**

The Congress Ministries' oppressive rule was the **direct cause** of the rapid evolution from:
- Separate representation (1909) → Separate organization (Muslim League, 1906)
- Political demands (1937) → Explicit separation demand (1940 Lahore Resolution)

**Historical Verdict:**

The Congress Ministries **justified the Two-Nation Theory completely**. They proved that a united India would result in **permanent Hindu domination** over Muslims. This experience made the demand for Pakistan not just desirable but necessary for Muslim survival.
