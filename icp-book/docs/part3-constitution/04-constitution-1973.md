# The Constitution of 1973

## Introduction

The **Constitution of 1973** is the supreme law of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and represents a landmark in the country's political history. It was passed by the National Assembly on **April 10, 1973**, and came into full force on **August 14, 1973**, during the government of **Zulfikar Ali Bhutto**.
