# The Constitution of 1956

## Introduction

After independence in 1947, Pakistan was governed under the **Government of India Act 1935** (as temporary constitution) for nine years. The long struggle to create a constitution finally succeeded under the Prime Ministership of **Chaudhry Muhammad Ali**.

The **first constitution was passed by the Constituent Assembly on February 29, 1956** and was enforced on **March 23, 1956**, marking Pakistan's transformation from a **Dominion** to a **Sovereign Islamic Republic**. It remained in force for about two and a half years before being cancelled by the first Martial Law in October 1958.

## Main Features of the 1956 Constitution

The Constitution of 1956 contained **234 Articles**, **13 Parts**, and **6 Schedules**. Its salient features were:

### 1. Written and Detailed Document

- It was a lengthy written document covering not only fundamental laws but also administrative details
- It was partly rigid and partly flexible, meaning amendments could be made with a **two-thirds majority** in the assembly
- Its comprehensive nature attempted to provide a complete framework for governance

### 2. Islamic Republic

For the first time, the country was officially named the **"Islamic Republic of Pakistan."** This declaration had significant ideological implications:

- **The Objectives Resolution was included as the Preamble**, declaring that sovereignty belongs to Allah Almighty
- It marked Pakistan's formal commitment to operating as an Islamic state
- The official name change reflected the nation's ideological identity

:::note Constitutional Achievement
The 1956 Constitution was the first constitution in the modern Muslim world to combine Islamic principles with parliamentary democracy.
:::

### 3. Federal System

The constitution established a **federal system** with two distinct provinces (units):

- **West Pakistan** (merged provinces and territories into one administrative unit)
- **East Pakistan** (Bengal region)

Powers were divided between the Centre and the Provinces through:
- **Federal List** (central government powers)
- **Provincial List** (provincial government powers)
- **Concurrent List** (shared powers)

### 4. Parliamentary Form of Government

The system adopted was **parliamentary**, with clear separation of powers:

**Head of Government:**
- The **Prime Minister** was the Head of Government and held real executive powers
- The PM and cabinet were collectively responsible to the National Assembly

**Head of State:**
- The **President** was the Head of State, largely ceremonial
- Had the power to appoint the PM and dissolve the assembly under specific conditions

### 5. One-House Legislature

Unlike the current two-house system, the 1956 Constitution introduced a **one-house legislature** known as the **National Assembly**.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Single house for all legislative business
- No separate upper house to represent provinces
- Debates and legislation conducted in one chamber

### 6. Principle of Equal Representation

To resolve the **representation conflict between East and West Pakistan**, the constitution adopted the **"Principle of Equal Representation."** This was controversial but represented a political compromise.

**The Equal Representation System:**
- The National Assembly consisted of **300 members**
- **150 members from East Pakistan** (despite having a larger population)
- **150 members from West Pakistan** (despite having a smaller population)
- Equal representation regardless of population difference

:::warning Contentious Principle
The equal representation principle was deeply unpopular in East Pakistan, as it denied the eastern region representation based on its population (about 55% of total). This resentment contributed to later tensions leading to the 1971 war.
:::

### 7. Independence of Judiciary

The constitution guaranteed an **independent judiciary**:

- The **Supreme Court** was the apex court
- Authority to interpret the constitution and enforce fundamental rights
- Protection of judges' tenure and independence from executive pressure

### 8. National Languages

Both **Urdu and Bengali** were declared the national languages of Pakistan:

- Addressed the demands of the Bengali population
- Represented an attempt to maintain national unity
- Later became a contentious issue

---

## Islamic Provisions

The 1956 Constitution included several specific Islamic provisions:

### 1. Muslim Head of State

It was **mandatory that the President of Pakistan must be a Muslim**, ensuring Islamic principles guided the highest office.

### 2. Laws Must Not Be Against Islam

**No law could be passed that was against the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah.** This provision:

- Protected the supremacy of Islamic law
- Created a constitutional safeguard for Islamic principles
- Allowed courts to strike down laws deemed un-Islamic

### 3. Islamic Ties

The state was **constitutionally bound to strengthen bonds with other Muslim countries**, emphasizing Pakistan's role in the Islamic world.

### 4. Elimination of Riba (Interest)

The state promised to work toward:
- **Eliminating Riba** (usury/interest)
- **Promoting Zakat** (almsgiving)
- **Promoting Wakf** (religious endowments)

## Fundamental Rights Under the 1956 Constitution

The constitution guaranteed fundamental rights to citizens, including:

| Right | Protection |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Freedom of Speech** | Freedom to express views |
| **Freedom of Assembly** | Right to gather peacefully |
| **Freedom of Movement** | Right to move throughout Pakistan |
| **Freedom of Religion** | Right to profess and practice faith |
| **Right to Property** | Acquisition and disposal of property |

These rights were enforceable by the courts, creating a mechanism for citizens to challenge governmental violations.

## Reasons for Failure and Abrogation

Despite its significance, the 1956 Constitution was short-lived. It was cancelled on **October 7, 1958** by President Iskander Mirza, leading to the imposition of Martial Law by General Ayub Khan. The constitution failed largely due to:

### 1. Political Instability

- Frequent changes in government
- Lack of organized political parties
- Absence of strong democratic traditions

### 2. Delay in General Elections

- General elections were never held under the 1956 Constitution
- No direct mandate from the people through voting
- Reliance on existing members of the Constituent Assembly

### 3. Parity Principle Tensions

- The equal representation principle fueled East Pakistani resentment
- Economic disparities between regions
- Language disputes (Urdu vs. Bengali)

### 4. Weak Executive

- The President's discretionary powers created uncertainty
- Cabinet instability
- Frequent dismissals and realignments

### 5. Constitutional Crises

- Disputes over the amendment process
- Conflicts between the President and Prime Minister
- Inability to reach consensus on key issues

:::note Military Intervention
The failure of the 1956 Constitution paved the way for General Ayub Khan's military coup in 1958, ending democratic governance for over a decade.

## Comparison: 1956 Constitution vs Later Constitutions

| Feature | 1956 | 1962 | 1973 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Form of Government** | Parliamentary | Presidential | Parliamentary |
| **Legislature** | Unicameral | Unicameral | Bicameral |
| **Head of Government** | PM (Real Power) | President (All Power) | PM (Real Power) |
| **Elections** | Never held | Indirect (Basic Democracies) | Direct |
| **Number of Articles** | 234 | 250+ | 280 |
| **Time in Force** | 2.5 years | 6 years | 50+ years |

## Conclusion

The Constitution of 1956 was a **significant milestone** as it broke the nine-year constitutional deadlock and transformed Pakistan from a dominion to a **sovereign Islamic Republic**. It represented the first serious attempt to create a constitutional framework that balanced Islamic principles with democratic governance.

However, its short lifespan reflected the political immaturity of the newly independent state. The parity principle, while attempting to bridge regional differences, created resentment in East Pakistan. The absence of general elections meant the constitution lacked popular legitimacy. Political instability and institutional conflicts ultimately rendered it unworkable.

Despite its failure, the 1956 Constitution established important precedents:

- **Islam as state religion** became a permanent feature
- **Federal structure** continued in later constitutions
- **Parliamentary democracy** remained the preferred model
- **Fundamental rights** became a constitutional staple

The lessons learned from the 1956 Constitution's collapse would inform the drafting of the **1973 Constitution**, which would prove far more durable and resilient.
