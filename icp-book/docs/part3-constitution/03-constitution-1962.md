# The Constitution of 1962

## Introduction

The Constitution of 1962 was the **second constitution of Pakistan**, promulgated by **President Ayub Khan** on **March 1, 1962**, and enforced on **June 8, 1962**. It was designed to legitimize the military regime and introduce a political system that Ayub Khan believed was better suited to Pakistan's conditions than the parliamentary model.

Unlike the 1956 Constitution, which was a consensus document drafted by elected representatives, the **1962 Constitution was largely the product of a single individual's vision**, establishing a highly centralized presidential system that concentrated power in the hands of the President.

:::warning Military Authoritarianism
The 1962 Constitution represented a departure from democratic principles and was designed to justify military rule by providing it with a legal framework.

## Key Features and Detailed Explanation

### 1. Presidential Form of Government

The most defining feature of the 1962 Constitution was the introduction of a **Presidential system**, fundamentally different from the parliamentary model of 1956.

**Head of State and Government:**
- The **President was both the Head of State and the Chief Executive**
- The office of the **Prime Minister was abolished**
- All executive authority was vested in the President

**Concentration of Power:**
- The President had the power to **appoint federal ministers**, provincial governors, and judges
- The legislature had very limited powers to check the President
- Critics described the system as a **"Clock Tower"** where all power radiated from one central point

**Veto Power:**
- The President had **extensive veto powers** over legislative bills passed by the National Assembly
- Could withhold assent or return bills for reconsideration
- Made it nearly impossible for the Assembly to override presidential decisions

:::note Ayub Khan's Rationale
Ayub Khan justified this concentration of power by arguing that parliamentary democracy had failed in Pakistan, and a strong executive was needed for national development and stability.
:::

### 2. Indirect Elections - The "Basic Democracies" System

Instead of direct universal suffrage, the constitution introduced a unique system called **"Basic Democracies"** for electoral purposes.

**Electoral College System:**
- The President and members of the National and Provincial Assemblies were elected **indirectly** by an **Electoral College**
- The Electoral College consisted of **80,000 "Basic Democrats"**
  - 40,000 from East Pakistan
  - 40,000 from West Pakistan

**Basic Democrats:**
- These were **local government representatives** at the village/town level
- Elected directly by the people
- Then formed the Electoral College to choose higher officials

**Rationale for Indirect Elections:**
The regime argued that:
- The masses were **illiterate** and "unripe" for democracy
- Direct universal suffrage would lead to poor decision-making
- Local representatives would be better judges of who should lead nationally
- This system would reduce the role of political parties

:::critical Criticism
This system was widely criticized as undemocratic, denying ordinary citizens the right to directly choose their national leaders. It became a symbol of Ayub Khan's paternalistic authoritarianism.
:::

### 3. Unicameral Legislature

The constitution established a **unicameral (single-house) legislature** known as the **National Assembly**.

**Composition:**
- Initially consisted of **156 members** (later increased)
- Provided **equal representation (parity)** to East and West Pakistan
- Despite the parity principle continuing from 1956, East Pakistan had a larger population

**Limited Powers:**
- The Assembly **could not vote on the budget** (except for new taxes)
- Made it financially powerless compared to the Executive
- Could debate but not ultimately decide on major financial matters
- Reduced legislative oversight of executive actions

**Purpose:**
- Served more as an **advisory body** than a legislative authority
- Provided a facade of democratic representation without real power
- Allowed the President to claim democratic legitimacy while maintaining control

### 4. Federal System with Strong Center

While nominally a federal constitution, it created a **highly centralized state**.

**Provincial Subordination:**
- **Provincial Governors were appointed by the President** and acted as his agents
- Governors were **not responsible to provincial assemblies** but to the President alone
- Provincial autonomy was severely restricted
- Center-province relationship was hierarchical, not federal

**One Unit Scheme:**
- The "**One Unit**" system in West Pakistan continued (where all western provinces were merged into one)
- This maintained parity with East Pakistan numerically
- Eliminated provincial identities (Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, KPK merged into one unit)
- Was extremely unpopular and resented by provinces

:::warning Provincial Resentment
The One Unit scheme was a major source of discontent, particularly among Sindhis and Balochis who felt their provincial identities were being erased.
:::

### 5. Islamic Provisions

The constitution retained the **Objective Resolution** as its preamble, but with modifications:

**Islamic Features:**
- Originally, the word "**Islamic**" was dropped from the country's name to read just "Republic of Pakistan"
- **Due to public pressure**, the First Amendment restored it to "**Islamic Republic of Pakistan**"
- Established an **Advisory Council of Islamic Ideology** to ensure laws conformed to Islam

**Islamic Ideology Council:**
- Advisory body, not enforceable
- Could recommend changes to bring laws in line with Islamic principles
- Had limited actual authority over legislation

## Structural Comparison: How Power Flowed

```
President Ayub Khan (Supreme Authority)
    ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
    │  │  │  └─→ 80,000 Basic Democrats
    │  │  └────→ National Assembly (Limited Power)
    │  └───────→ Provincial Governors (Appointed)
    └──────────→ Judges & Cabinet (Appointed)

Citizens (Could Only Vote for Local Basic Democrats)
```

This structure shows the **centralization** of all power in the President's hands, with citizens having minimal direct influence.

## Reasons for the Constitution's Failure

### 1. Lack of Popular Support

The 1962 Constitution was seen as:
- A tool to perpetuate one-man rule
- An instrument of military authoritarianism
- A denial of people's democratic rights
- Lacking legitimacy because it wasn't drafted by elected representatives

### 2. Denial of Direct Voting

- By denying the people the right to direct voting, it created deep resentment
- Citizens felt excluded from governance decisions
- The "Basic Democracies" system was seen as patronizing and undemocratic

### 3. Provincial Oppression

- The **One Unit scheme** created resentment, particularly in East Pakistan
- East Pakistanis felt their majority was ignored through artificial parity
- West Pakistan's forced merger of provinces eliminated regional identities
- Smaller provinces felt dominated by Punjab

### 4. Weak Checks and Balances

- The National Assembly could not effectively check presidential power
- No mechanism to remove the President short of military intervention
- Judiciary was subservient to the President
- Created an environment ripe for abuse

### 5. Economic Inequality

- While Ayub Khan pursued "**decade of development**" policies
- Economic benefits accrued mainly to big industrialists and landowners
- Common people saw little improvement
- Wealth concentration increased

### 6. Mass Agitation

When mass agitation against Ayub Khan erupted in **1968-69**:
- Students, workers, and political parties protested
- The constitutional machinery proved inadequate to manage grievances
- Ayub Khan was forced to resign
- The government collapsed

:::note The Agitation of 1968-69
This period is significant in Pakistani history as it saw the first successful popular uprising against an authoritarian regime, eventually leading to the resignation of General Ayub Khan.

## End of the 1962 Constitution

On **March 25, 1969**, **General Yahya Khan** (who succeeded Ayub Khan) abrogated the 1962 Constitution and imposed **Martial Law**, marking the end of Ayub Khan's "decade of development" and his political system.

Yahya Khan promised:
- General elections to elect a Constituent Assembly
- A new democratic constitution
- Restoration of democracy

However, these elections would lead to the **1971 civil war** and the **creation of Bangladesh**, a watershed moment in Pakistan's history.

## Key Differences: 1956 vs. 1962

| Aspect | 1956 Constitution | 1962 Constitution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Form of Government** | Parliamentary | **Presidential** |
| **Head of Government** | Prime Minister | **President** |
| **Elections** | Direct (promised) | **Indirect (Basic Democracies)** |
| **Legislature** | National Assembly (Sovereign) | **National Assembly (Limited)** |
| **Budget Control** | Assembly votes on budget | **President controls budget** |
| **Provincial Powers** | Provinces autonomous | **Governors appointed, subservient** |
| **Duration** | 2.5 years | 6-7 years |
| **Why Failed** | Political instability | Lack of democratic legitimacy |

---

## Conclusion

The Constitution of 1962 failed to gain popular support because it was seen as a **tool to perpetuate military-authoritarian rule**. By denying the people the right to direct voting and suppressing provincial autonomy, it created deep resentment, particularly in East Pakistan. The system lacked checks and balances, and when mass agitation erupted in 1968-69, the constitutional machinery proved inadequate to manage grievances.

**Key Lessons from the 1962 Constitution:**

1. **Undemocratic systems lack legitimacy** - Indirect elections don't substitute for democracy
2. **Centralization breeds resentment** - Federal systems require genuine provincial autonomy
3. **Concentration of power is unstable** - Checks and balances are essential for longevity
4. **A constitution needs popular consent** - Documents imposed by rulers lack durability

The **1973 Constitution** would learn from these failures, returning to parliamentary democracy and introducing a **bicameral legislature** to better protect provincial interests. Unlike the 1962 Constitution, the 1973 Constitution would survive for over 50 years because it was drafted through democratic consensus and allowed for greater democratic participation.

## 📚 Memory Tips

### The "1962 Remember" Dates:
- **March 1, 1962** → Constitution promulgated
- **June 8, 1962** → Constitution enforced
- **March 25, 1969** → Constitution abrogated

### Ayub Khan's System - **"PAIN"** Mnemonic:
- **P**residential System (not Parliamentary)
- **A**uthoritarianism (centralized power)
- **I**ndirect Elections (Basic Democracies)
- **N**ational Assembly (powerless)

### Key Feature Acronym - **"PUNCH"**:
- **P**residential System (1st time)
- **U**nicameral Legislature
- **N**ational Assembly (weak)
- **C**entralized (One Unit)
- **H**ierarchical federalism

### What Made It Unpopular - **"OPPRESS"**:
- **O**ne Unit (provincial merger)
- **P**residential Dictatorship
- **P**arity Principle (unfair to East Pakistan)
- **R**estricted voting (Basic Democracies)

### Comparing All Three Constitutions - Quick Reference:

| Constitution | PM or President? | Direct or Indirect Elections | How Long? | Ended How? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1956** | **PM** (Parliamentary) | **Direct** (never held) | 2.5 years | Military coup |
| **1962** | **President** | **Indirect** (Basic Democracies) | 7 years | Popular uprising |
| **1973** | **PM** (Parliamentary) | **Direct** | 50+ years | Still in force! |

### Why 1973 Lasted While 1962 Failed:

**1962 = Authoritarian** → Centralized, undemocratic → Collapsed
**1973 = Democratic** → Participatory, federal → Endured

### The "Basic Democrats" Concept:
Think of it like this:
- Citizens → Vote for Basic Democrats
- Basic Democrats (80,000) → Vote for President & Assembly
- This was seen as **too many layers removed** from people's choice
