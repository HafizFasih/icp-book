# Constitutional Amendment Procedure

## Introduction

The Constitution of Pakistan (1973) is classified as a **rigid constitution**, meaning it cannot be altered by a simple majority like ordinary laws. The framers intentionally made the amendment process difficult to ensure **political stability** and protect the **rights of the federating units (provinces)**.

The specific procedure for amending the constitution is enshrined in **Part XI, Articles 238 and 239**.

- **Article 238** grants Parliament the power to amend the constitution
- **Article 239** details the specific legislative steps required to do so

This rigidity is a defining feature—it protects the constitution from arbitrary changes while allowing evolution through consensus-based amendment.

:::success Constitutional Protection
By making amendments difficult, the framers ensured that hasty or partisan changes could not undermine the constitutional framework without broad agreement across political parties and provinces.

## The Philosophy Behind Rigid Amendment Procedures

### Why Make Amendments Difficult?

**1. Stability and Predictability:**
- Prevents constitution from being constantly rewritten
- Provides legal certainty and stability
- Allows governance based on established rules

**2. Protection of Minorities:**
- Requires consensus beyond simple majority
- Prevents tyranny of majority from altering fundamental structure
- Protects smaller provinces and minorities

**3. Preserving Federal Character:**
- Requires provincial consent for boundary changes
- Protects federalism as core principle
- Ensures no province can be arbitrarily altered

**4. Democratic Legitimacy:**
- Requires super-majority (two-thirds)
- Demonstrates broad political consensus
- Reflects will of multiple parties and interests

### The Balance:

**Rigid Enough To:**
- Prevent arbitrary changes
- Protect core constitutional values
- Require genuine consensus
- Maintain federalism

**Flexible Enough To:**
- Allow evolution with changed circumstances
- Permit 26 amendments since 1973
- Adapt to new challenges (terrorism, environment)
- Incorporate modern rights (education, information)

## Detailed Procedure for Amendment (Articles 238-239)

The process of amending the Constitution of Pakistan involves the following distinct stages:

### 1. Initiation of the Bill (Article 239-1)

**Who Can Introduce?**
A Constitutional Amendment Bill can originate in **either House** of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament):
- **National Assembly** (Lower House)
- **Senate** (Upper House)

**Flexibility:**
Unlike ordinary Money Bills (which must originate in the National Assembly), constitutional amendments have no such restriction. This ensures both houses have equal power in constitutional matters.

**Introduction Process:**
- Bill is formally introduced in the House of origin
- Government or opposition members can introduce
- Typically introduced by government but opposition can also move

:::note Parliamentary Equality
Allowing amendments to originate in either house reflects the equal importance of both chambers in constitutional matters, despite their different compositions.
:::

### 2. Approval by the First House

**The Critical "Two-Thirds Requirement":**

Once introduced, the Constitutional Amendment Bill must be passed by a **two-thirds majority** of the **total membership** of that House.

**Key Point - "Total Membership" Not "Members Present":**

This is a crucial distinction:
- **Not just 2/3 of members present** on the day of voting
- Must be **2/3 of all seats that exist** in the House

**Example:**
- National Assembly has 270 general seats (before reserved seats)
- Two-thirds of 270 = 180 members
- If 150 members are present in parliament, 100 voting yes is NOT enough
- Need 180 members voting yes (even if many are absent)

**Why This Requirement?**
- Prevents snap votes with low attendance
- Requires substantial support, not just present members
- Demonstrates genuine consensus across party lines
- Makes coalition-building necessary

**Calculation for Senate:**
- Senate has 104 seats (23 from each province + 4 from FATA)
- Two-thirds = 70 senators needed
- Same principle applies

### 3. Transmission to the Second House

**Movement to Second House:**
After being passed by the first House with two-thirds majority, the bill is **transmitted to the other House**.

**The Other House's Task:**
The second House also debates the bill and must pass it with the same **two-thirds majority** of its total membership.

**This Ensures:**
- Both houses agree on the amendment
- Smaller provinces (via Senate) have voice
- Larger population (via National Assembly) has voice
- Consensus across both chambers

---

### 4. Handling Disagreements - The Deadlock Scenario

This is a critical aspect of the procedure. There are three possible outcomes:

#### Scenario 1: Passed Without Amendment

**If the second House passes the bill exactly as received:**
- No further action needed in the originating house
- Ready for Presidential assent
- Amendment can proceed to approval stage

**Advantage:**
- Smooth passage when both houses agree

#### Scenario 2: Passed with Amendments

**If the second House introduces changes or modifications:**
- Bill is **sent back to the originating House**
- The originating House must **reconsider the amended version**
- Must pass the **amended bill** by **two-thirds majority**

**Iterative Process:**
- If originating house rejects amendments, bill dies
- If originating house accepts amendments, continues
- Second house must then reconsider if more changes made
- Process continues until agreement reached or stalls

**Complex When Disagreement:**
Multiple rounds possible:
1. First House passes (2/3)
2. Second House amends
3. First House reconsiders
4. Back and forth if continued disagreement

#### Scenario 3: Deadlock - Rejection or Impasse

**If disagreement is fundamental:**
- The second House might **reject the bill entirely**
- Or the **houses cannot reach agreement** despite multiple rounds

**No Joint Sitting Provision:**

**This is crucial:** Unlike ordinary bills where deadlocks can be resolved through a **Joint Sitting** of Parliament (both houses meeting together), **constitutional amendments have NO provision for Joint Sitting**.

**Implication:**
- If the two houses cannot agree, **the amendment bill dies**
- No mechanism to force passage
- Requires genuine agreement between both houses
- Deadlock means the amendment cannot proceed

**Why No Joint Sitting for Amendments?**
- Protects federalism and provincial interests
- Senate (equal provincial representation) cannot be overridden
- Prevents larger house (National Assembly) from dominating
- Requires genuine federal consensus

:::info Federal Safeguard
The absence of a Joint Sitting provision for constitutional amendments is a federal safeguard ensuring that smaller provinces cannot be overridden by the larger National Assembly.
:::

---

### 5. Special Provision: Altering Provincial Limits (Article 239-4)

**A Critical Federal Protection:**

If an amendment bill seeks to **alter the limits (boundaries)** of a province, additional safeguards apply:

**Extra Requirement:**
The amendment bill **cannot be presented to the President** for assent unless it has been **passed by the Provincial Assembly** of that affected province.

**Provincial Assembly Requirement:**
- The Provincial Assembly must pass the bill
- Also requires **two-thirds majority** of its total membership
- This gives the affected province a veto-like power

**Affected Province:**
Any province whose boundaries might be changed must approve:
- Punjab cannot have its boundaries changed without Punjab Assembly consent
- Sindh cannot be altered without Sindh Assembly approval
- Similarly for KPK and Balochistan

**Examples:**
- Redrawing provincial boundaries
- Creating new provinces (e.g., South Punjab proposal would need Punjab Assembly approval)
- Merging provinces (the 25th Amendment merged FATA with KPK, likely required KPK Assembly consent)
- Splitting provinces

**Significance:**
- Protects provincial autonomy
- Prevents center from arbitrarily altering provinces
- Gives local democratic voice in boundary matters
- Reflects federal principle

:::note Federal Principle
This provision exemplifies Pakistan's federal structure—no major change to provincial identity can happen without provincial participation in decision-making.
:::

---

### 6. Presidential Assent (Article 239-2)

**Final Stage:**

Once the bill has been passed by:
- Both Houses (with two-thirds majorities), AND
- Provincial Assembly (if boundaries affected)

The bill is presented to the **President for assent**.

**Presidential Role:**
Unlike ordinary bills, the **President has NO power to return** a Constitutional Amendment Bill to Parliament for reconsideration.

**What This Means:**
- **The President SHALL assent** to the bill
- Assent is **mandatory and automatic**
- Once both houses have passed it, passage is certain
- President cannot withhold assent
- Cannot send back to parliament for further debate

**Why No Presidential Discretion?**
- Prevents President from blocking democratic decisions
- Constitutional amendments express parliamentary will
- President is ceremonial in parliamentary system
- After 18th Amendment, President has minimal executive power

**Historical Note:**
Even when Presidents had more power, they could not refuse assent to constitutional amendments passed by the required majorities. This reflects the supremacy of Parliament in constitutional matters.

## Comparison: Constitutional Amendment vs. Ordinary Legislation

| Aspect | Ordinary Bill | Constitutional Amendment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Majority Required** | Simple majority (50%+1) | Two-thirds majority |
| **Membership Requirement** | Members present | Total membership |
| **Original House** | Money bills in NA only | Can originate in either house |
| **Second House Deadlock** | Joint Sitting available | No Joint Sitting provision |
| **Presidential Power** | Can return for reconsideration | Must give assent |
| **Provincial Boundary** | Not applicable | Provincial Assembly approval required |
| **Ease of Passage** | Easier | Much harder |
| **Flexibility** | Easy to change | Requires broad consensus |
| **Stability** | Changes frequently | Changes rarely |

## Practical Examples of Amendment Process

### Example 1: The 18th Amendment (2010)

**Proposed by:** PPP government under Asif Ali Zardari
**Passed by:** National Assembly with two-thirds majority (April 8, 2010)
**Passed by:** Senate with two-thirds majority
**Special Check:** No provincial boundaries affected
**Presidential Assent:** Mandatory
**Result:** Became law, removing Article 58(2)(b), abolishing Concurrent List

**Success Factors:**
- All major parties supported (consensus)
- Unanimous passage showed broad agreement
- No provincial objections
- Smooth passage through both houses

### Example 2: The 25th Amendment (2018)

**Proposed by:** Government regarding FATA merger with KPK
**Passed by:** National Assembly with two-thirds majority
**Passed by:** Senate with two-thirds majority
**Special Check:** AFFECTED PROVINCE = KPK
- **KPK Assembly** had to approve (affected by boundary/jurisdictional change)
- **KPK approved** merger with two-thirds majority
**Presidential Assent:** Given
**Result:** FATA formally merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

**Why It Took Longer:**
- Required provincial assembly approval
- Negotiations between federal and provincial governments needed
- KPK government had to agree
- Added step extended timeline

### Example 3: Hypothetical - Creating South Punjab Province

**Proposed by:** Government suggesting South Punjab as separate province
**Would Require:**
1. National Assembly: Two-thirds vote
2. Senate: Two-thirds vote
3. **Punjab Assembly: Two-thirds vote** (because boundary of Punjab altered)
4. Presidential Assent

**Why Difficult:**
- Punjab is largest and most powerful province
- Punjab Assembly likely to oppose (losing territory)
- Needs two-thirds (harder than simple majority)
- Would take multiple years of negotiation

**Historical Note:** South Punjab has been proposed multiple times but not passed because of Punjab Assembly opposition and lack of two-thirds majority in that assembly.

## The Rigidity Index: Pakistan's Amendment Difficulty

Pakistan's amendment procedure is **very rigid**, compared to other democracies:

### Comparative Amendment Difficulty:

| Country | Requirement | Difficulty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **India** | 2/3 majority in parliament | Rigid |
| **Australia** | Referendum + majority vote | Very Rigid |
| **Pakistan** | 2/3 in both houses + provincial consent (if boundary) | Very Rigid |
| **USA** | 2/3 in Congress + 3/4 states | Very Rigid |
| **UK** | Simple majority | Flexible |
| **Canada** | Varies by section (2/3 to unanimous) | Rigid |

**Pakistan's rigidity** reflects its status as a federal, multi-party state where consensus-building is essential.

## Challenges and Critiques of the Amendment Procedure

### Challenges:

**1. Time-Consuming:**
- Requires passage through both houses
- Possible iterations if disagreement
- Provincial approval adds time
- Can take years to pass major amendments

**2. Promotes Gridlock:**
- Deadlock between houses possible
- Prevents urgent constitutional reforms
- Single provincial opposition can block
- Slows response to crises

**3. Requires Broad Consensus:**
- Difficult to achieve two-thirds majority
- Requires cross-party agreement
- Smaller parties gain leverage
- Can lead to political bargaining

**4. Inflexibility:**
- Cannot respond quickly to changing circumstances
- Stability can become stagnation
- Revolutionary changes not possible constitutionally

### Why These Are Actually Strengths:

**Counter-Arguments:**
- **Stability:** Prevents whimsical constitutional changes
- **Federal Protection:** Prevents majority dominance
- **Democratic Consensus:** Ensures broad agreement
- **Constitutional Preservation:** Protects core values

:::note Balance
The difficulties in amendment are features, not bugs—they reflect the framers' belief that constitutional change should require genuine national consensus, not partisan majorities.
:::

## Success Rate of Constitutional Amendments

Since 1973, Pakistan has passed **26 constitutional amendments**, showing the procedure works:

- **Successful Amendments:** 26 (approximately)
- **Failed Attempts:** Multiple (exact number unclear, but several proposals blocked)
- **Average Time:** Varies from months to years

**Why Some Pass and Others Fail:**

**Amendments That Passed:**
- Had broad political support or military backing
- Addressed non-controversial issues
- Didn't threaten provincial interests
- Had clear national consensus (e.g., 18th Amendment)

**Amendments That Failed or Stalled:**
- South Punjab proposal (Punjab assembly opposed)
- Various provincial reorganization proposals
- Some territorial boundary changes
- Controversial ideological amendments

---

## Conclusion

The constitutional amendment procedure outlined in **Articles 238 and 239** creates a **deliberately rigid process** designed to:

1. **Protect fundamental principles** from easy change
2. **Ensure federal balance** through provincial consent
3. **Require democratic consensus** via two-thirds majorities
4. **Prevent tyranny of majority** through these safeguards

While the procedure is **difficult and time-consuming**, this reflects the framers' wisdom that constitutional changes of this magnitude require **genuine national agreement** rather than simple partisan victories.

The procedure has proven **workable but challenging**—26 amendments in 50 years represents both successful reform capacity and resistance to frivolous changes. The **18th Amendment (2010)** particularly demonstrated that genuine national consensus can overcome even the rigidity of this procedure.

As Pakistan continues to evolve, the amendment procedure remains the **constitutional gateway for fundamental reforms**, requiring that any major change to the state's structure and principles gain **broad democratic agreement** across all political parties and federating units.

## 📚 Memory Tips

### The "6 Steps" to Amendment - **"I-A-T-A-S-P"**:
- **I**nitiation (Either house can introduce)
- **A**pproval by First House (Two-thirds majority)
- **T**ransmission to Second House
- **A**pproval by Second House (Two-thirds majority)
- **S**pecial Check (If province boundary affected, need provincial assembly approval)
- **P**residential Assent (Mandatory)

### The "Two-Thirds Majority" Mnemonic:
**Remember:** It's 2/3 of **TOTAL MEMBERSHIP**, not members present!
- National Assembly: 270 seats → 180 needed (2/3)
- Senate: 104 seats → 70 needed (2/3)

### Key "Two-Thirds" Point:
Think: **"Two-thirds of SEATS, not VOTES"**
- If 150 members are present and 100 vote yes, it still fails if total is 270!
- Need 180 voting yes (even if many are absent)

### The "Three Outcomes" at Second House - **"Pass-Modify-Reject"**:
- **Pass** (without amendment) → Ready for assent
- **Modify** (with amendments) → Back to first house
- **Reject** → Bill dies (no Joint Sitting!)

### The "No Joint Sitting" Rule:
**CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS ≠ ORDINARY BILLS**
- Ordinary bills: If houses disagree → Joint Sitting (both houses vote together)
- Constitutional amendments: If houses disagree → DEADLOCK (bill dies)
- Why? Protects federalism and smaller provinces

### The "Special Provincial Check":
**IF boundary changes** → **Affected province's assembly must approve** (also 2/3 majority)
- Changes to Punjab boundaries → Punjab Assembly consent needed
- Changes to Sindh → Sindh Assembly consent needed
- FATA merger → KPK Assembly consent needed

### The "Presidential Power" - What President CANNOT Do:
❌ **Cannot refuse assent** to constitutional amendment
❌ **Cannot return for reconsideration** (unlike ordinary bills)
❌ **Cannot delay** the process
✅ **Must give assent** when bill reaches them

### The "Rigidity Scale" - **"VRVRV"** (Voting Requirements):
- **V**ery easy (Simple majority) = Flexible constitution
- **R**igid (Two-thirds one house) = More rigid
- **V**ery Rigid (Two-thirds BOTH houses) = Very rigid
- **R**equires MORE (Plus provincial assembly) = Super rigid
- **V**ery stable (Like Pakistan's) = Constitution rarely changes arbitrarily

**Pakistan = VRRV level (Very-Rigid-Requires-more-Very stable)**

### Self-Test Questions:

1. What is the difference between "simple majority" and "two-thirds of total membership"?
2. Can a constitutional amendment bill originate in the Senate?
3. What happens if the second house passes the bill with amendments?
4. Why is there no Joint Sitting provision for constitutional amendments?
5. When does a province's assembly need to approve an amendment?
6. What is the President's role in giving assent to a constitutional amendment?
7. Give an example of an amendment that required provincial assembly approval.
8. Compare the procedure for amending the constitution vs. passing ordinary laws.
9. Why did the framers make constitutional amendments so rigid/difficult?
10. How many amendments have been passed since 1973?

### Visual Memory Aid:

```
RIGID CONSTITUTION PROCEDURE:

START → Two Houses → Two-Thirds → Both Must Agree → Check Provinces → Presidential Assent

Obstacles:
- Need 2/3, not simple majority ✓ Harder
- Must be 2/3 of total seats ✓ Harder (absent members count against)
- Second house can amend ✓ Harder (may need multiple rounds)
- No Joint Sitting to resolve ✓ Harder (deadlock possible)
- Provincial approval if boundary ✓ Hardest

Result: VERY RIGID CONSTITUTION
