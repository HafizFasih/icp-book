# Fundamental Rights (Articles 8-25)

## Introduction

**Fundamental Rights** are the basic human rights guaranteed to every citizen of a state, ensuring their liberty, dignity, and equality. In the **Constitution of Pakistan 1973**, these rights are enshrined in **Part II, Chapter 1 (Articles 8–28)**.

These rights are considered **"enforceable in court,"** meaning that if the state violates these rights, a citizen can approach the **High Court** (under Article 199) or the **Supreme Court** (under Article 184(3)) for enforcement. This judicial enforcement mechanism is crucial—it transforms fundamental rights from merely theoretical declarations into enforceable legal protections.

The fundamental rights form the **bedrock of democracy in Pakistan**, limiting the power of the state and protecting the individual from tyranny and governmental excess.

:::success Constitutional Protection
The inclusion of court-enforceable fundamental rights ensures that citizens are not merely subjects of the state but rights-bearing individuals whose dignity and liberty are constitutionally protected.

## Categorization of Fundamental Rights

The Fundamental Rights can be broadly categorized into several groups:

1. **Supremacy of Rights** (Article 8)
2. **Security and Personal Liberty** (Articles 9–14)
3. **Political and Civil Freedoms** (Articles 15–19A)
4. **Religious Freedoms** (Articles 20–22)
5. **Property and Equality** (Articles 23–25A)

Each category addresses different dimensions of human dignity and freedom.

## 1. Supremacy of Fundamental Rights (Article 8)

**Article 8** serves as the **protective shield** for all other rights.

### Key Provision:
**"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the Fundamental Rights."**

### Significance:

- **Any law inconsistent with Fundamental Rights is void**
- The state is **prohibited** from making laws that take away or abridge these rights
- The **judiciary has the power to strike down such laws**
- Creates a **hierarchy of law**: Constitution > Fundamental Rights > Ordinary Laws

### Example:
If Parliament passes a law that violates freedom of speech or denies equality before the law, the Supreme Court can declare that law unconstitutional and void, even if Parliament enacted it with large majorities.

:::note Constitutional Supremacy
This article establishes that the Constitution, and particularly Fundamental Rights, stand above all other laws, making them the ultimate standard of legality.

## 2. Security and Personal Liberty (Articles 9–14)
