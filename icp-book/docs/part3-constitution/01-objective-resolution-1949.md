# The Objective Resolution (1949)

## Introduction

The **Objective Resolution** is one of the most significant documents in the constitutional history of Pakistan. It was moved by the first Prime Minister, **Liaquat Ali Khan**, and was passed by the Constituent Assembly on **March 12, 1949**. This resolution laid the foundation for the future constitutions of the country by outlining the fundamental principles and ideology upon which the state of Pakistan would be governed.

Often referred to as the **"Magna Carta" of Pakistan's constitutional history**, the Objective Resolution resolved the early conflict regarding the ideological direction of the new state. It remains a cornerstone of Pakistan's constitutional framework, serving as the preamble to the 1956 and 1962 constitutions and being incorporated as **Article 2A** in the 1973 Constitution through the Eighth Amendment in 1985.

:::info Historical Significance
The Objective Resolution successfully balanced Islam and democracy, establishing a unique model of governance that would guide Pakistan's constitutional development for decades to come.

## Main Features of the Resolution

The Objective Resolution provided a broad framework for the state's operations. Its key features are:

### 1. Sovereignty of Allah

The resolution began with the declaration that **sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to Allah Almighty alone**. It clarified that the authority exercised by the people of Pakistan is a **sacred trust** and must be exercised within the limits prescribed by Him.

This principle set Pakistan apart from secular democratic states, establishing that all governmental authority is ultimately derived from Divine will.

### 2. Delegated Authority and Democracy

The resolution established that the state would exercise its powers and authority through the **chosen representatives of the people**. This affirmed the democratic nature of the state, ensuring that governance was not the right of a specific individual or family but of the elected representatives.

This principle balanced religious sovereignty with democratic accountability, creating a unique system of governance.

### 3. Islamic Principles

The resolution mandated that the principles of **democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance, and social justice**, as enunciated by Islam, would be fully observed. This distinguished Pakistan's democracy as one guided by Islamic ethics rather than secular Western models alone.

The resolution emphasized that these principles would be enshrined in all future constitutions and laws.

### 4. Muslim Way of Life

The resolution ensured that **Muslims would be enabled to order their lives**, both individually and collectively, in accordance with the teachings and requirements of Islam as set out in the **Holy Quran and Sunnah**.

This provision addressed the core demand of the Pakistan Movement—creating a homeland where Muslims could live according to Islamic principles.

:::note Islamic Emphasis
The inclusion of Quran and Sunnah as the basis for Muslim life ensured the state's commitment to Islamic governance while maintaining flexibility in implementation.

### 5. Protection of Minorities

Despite being an Islamic state, the resolution **explicitly guaranteed adequate provision for minorities** to freely profess and practice their religions and develop their cultures. It ensured that their legitimate interests and fundamental rights would be safeguarded.

This principle established that Pakistan's Islamic character did not mean the marginalization of non-Muslim citizens.

### 6. Federal System

The resolution decided that **Pakistan would be a Federation**, where the constituent units (provinces) would be autonomous within the limits defined by the constitution. This principle laid the groundwork for provincial autonomy while maintaining federal unity.

### 7. Fundamental Rights

The resolution guaranteed **fundamental rights** to all citizens, including:

- **Equality of status and opportunity**
- **Equality before the law**
- **Freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, worship, and association**
- **Protection of life and property**

These rights were to be enforceable by the courts, creating a mechanism to protect citizens against state tyranny.

### 8. Independence of the Judiciary

The document emphasized that the **independence of the judiciary would be fully secured**, ensuring that justice would be dispensed without fear or pressure from the executive. This principle was critical to the rule of law and constitutionalism.

## Philosophical Framework: Islam and Democracy

One of the Objective Resolution's greatest achievements was synthesizing **Islamic principles** with **modern democracy**. It rejected the notion that these were incompatible.

### The Islamic Contribution:

- **Tauheed** (Oneness of God) → Sovereignty of Allah
- **Amanah** (Sacred Trust) → Democratic responsibility
- **Adl** (Justice) → Equality and Rule of Law
- **Rahma** (Mercy) → Minority protection

### The Democratic Contribution:

- **Representation** → Chosen representatives of the people
- **Accountability** → Government answerable to the people
- **Participation** → Citizens' voice in governance
- **Checks and Balances** → Independent judiciary

This synthesis created what scholars call **"Islamic Democracy"** or **"Controlled Democracy,"** a system where democratic principles operate within the parameters of Islam.

## Impact on Later Constitutions

The Objective Resolution's influence on Pakistan's constitutional evolution was profound:

| Constitution | Role | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1956 Constitution** | Served as **Preamble** | Non-enforceable preface |
| **1962 Constitution** | Served as **Preamble** | Non-enforceable preface |
| **1973 Constitution** | Included as **Preamble** | Non-enforceable preface initially |
| **1973 (8th Amendment, 1985)** | Inserted as **Article 2A** | Made **enforceable** and substantive |

The **Eighth Amendment (1985)** was particularly significant as it transformed the Objective Resolution from a **non-justiciable preamble** into **substantive constitutional law**, making it enforceable in courts.

:::warning Controversial Amendment
The 8th Amendment's incorporation of Article 2A was controversial, as critics argued it gave excessive power to interpret Islamic principles, potentially limiting fundamental rights. The Supreme Court has since developed jurisprudence to balance Article 2A with fundamental rights.

## Conclusion

The Objective Resolution was a landmark achievement that defined the **ideological identity of Pakistan**. It successfully blended the concepts of modern democracy with the principles of Islam, aiming to create a welfare state where:

- The sovereignty of Allah is acknowledged
- The people exercise governance through representatives
- Islamic values guide the state's actions
- Minorities are protected
- Individual rights are guaranteed

Its importance is evident from its enduring role in Pakistan's constitutional framework. More than 75 years after its passage, the Objective Resolution remains the philosophical foundation of Pakistan's governance, serving as a reminder of the country's unique identity as an ideological state rooted in Islam yet committed to democratic principles.

As Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah stated, Pakistan was created not just for a piece of land but as a **laboratory for Islamic principles**, and the Objective Resolution remains the constitutional blueprint for this vision.
