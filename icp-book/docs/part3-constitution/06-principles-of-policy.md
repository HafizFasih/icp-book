# Principles of Policy (Articles 29-40)

## Introduction

The **Principles of Policy** are contained in **Part II, Chapter 2** (Articles 29 to 40) of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973. While "**Fundamental Rights**" (Chapter 1) are legally enforceable by courts, the **Principles of Policy serve as a constitutional framework and ethical guide for the state**.

They set the **ideological direction** for the government, outlining the socio-economic and political goals the state must strive to achieve. Think of them as the **"Manifesto of the State"** or the **"Aspirational Goals"** of Pakistan's governance.

### Key Distinction:

| Fundamental Rights | Principles of Policy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enforceable in courts** | **Not enforceable in courts** |
| Citizens can sue if violated | Citizens cannot sue for non-implementation |
| Mandatory, immediate application | Guidelines, long-term implementation |
| Protect individual liberty | Guide state policy direction |

:::note Not Enforceable in Courts but Important
Although not legally enforceable through courts, Article 29 mandates that **every organ of the state must act in accordance with these principles**. They form the constitutional conscience of the state.

## Framework and Responsibility

### Article 29: Definition and Scope

**"The principles of policy set out in this Chapter shall be regarded as fundamental in the governance of the State."**

**Key Implications:**
- These are **fundamental to governance**, not optional
- Must guide all state policies and decisions
- **Every organ and authority** (executive, legislature, judiciary) must follow them
- Serve as **constitutional guidance** for policymaking
- Represent the **ideological commitments** of Pakistan

### Article 30: Legal Status and Not Enforceable in Courts

**"The validity of an action or law cannot be questioned in court on the ground that it violates the Principles of Policy."**

**What This Means:**
- Courts **cannot strike down laws** on grounds of violating these principles alone
- However, violations can be used as **supporting evidence** for other constitutional violations
- Protects the state from litigation while maintaining symbolic importance
- Acknowledges that implementation depends on **available resources** and circumstances

**Why Not Enforceable in Courts?**
- These are long-term, resource-dependent goals
- Depend on economic conditions and development
- Cannot be implemented overnight
- Require flexibility in timing and implementation
- Courts cannot micro-manage state resources

:::info Judicial Use
While not directly enforceable, courts have cited these principles in interpreting other rights and striking down discriminatory laws that violate them.

## Detailed Explanation of Articles (29 to 40)

### A. Islamic and Social Obligations

#### Article 31: Islamic Way of Life

**"The State shall take steps to enable the Muslims of Pakistan to order their lives in accordance with the fundamental principles and basic concepts of Islam."**

**Specific Obligations:**
The state must:

1. **Make teaching of Quran and Islamiat (Islamic Studies) compulsory** in educational institutions
   - Ensures Muslim youth understand Islamic principles

#### Article 32: Promotion of Local Government

**"The State shall endeavor to strengthen the bonds of unity amongst the Muslim countries and to promote international peace."**

Wait, that's actually Article 40! Let me correct:

**Article 32: Promotion of Local Government (Actually)**

**"The State shall encourage local government institutions composed of elected representatives of the people, and in such institutions special representation shall be given to peasants, workers and women."**

## Conclusion

- Maintain international peace

The **spirit of these principles** guides Pakistan toward becoming a true **Islamic Welfare State**, balancing modern governance with Islamic values and social justice.
